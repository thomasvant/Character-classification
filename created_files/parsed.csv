phoebe|oh yeah
rachel|everything you need to know is in that first kiss

ross|yeah and and it's not that we don't like the comedian it's that that
ross|that's not why we bought the ticket
chandler|the problem is though after the concert's over no matter how great the show was you girls are always looking for the comedian again y'know
chandler|i mean we're in the car we're fighting traffic
chandler|basically just trying to stay awake
rachel|yeah well word of advice bring back the comedian

ross|phoebs what about you
ross|disneyland it's a small world after all
ross|the ride broke down
ross|so carol and i went behind a couple of those mechanical dutch children

ross|step back
joey|we have a winner
ross|well it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line
ross|come on
ross|and you didn't marry him because
ross|probably
ross|but you know i'll tell you something
ross|passion is way overrated
ross|it is
ross|eventually it kind of
ross|burns out
ross|but hopefully what you're left with is trust and security and
ross|well in the case of my ex wife lesbianism
ross|so you know for all of those people who miss out on that passion
ross|thing there's all that other good stuff
ross|but um
ross|i don't think that's going to be you

ross|big passion in your future
ross|mmmm

phoebe|try listening to stella niedman tell the story of her and rod steiger for the hundredth time
joey|uh pheebs how long do you think this lady'll be with us

chandler|hey janice
chandler|it's me
chandler|um yeah i i i just wanna apologize in advance for having chased you down the street
rachel|honey this will help
chandler|so i finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down
monica|that is never good
chandler|then i got all needy and clingy
rachel|okay wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute
rachel|maybe it's not so bad

monica|you know when you start get screwed over all the time you gotta switch to low fat
rachel|yeah you do

monica|well no not at all you're not terminal you just you just need some damage control

chandler|so should i call her
rachel|this is a very critical time right now
rachel|if you feel yourself reaching for that phone then you go shoe shopping you get your butt in a bubble bath
rachel|you want her back you have to start acting aloof
monica|she has to know that your not ready
rachel|right
rachel|so what you have to do is you have to accidentally run into her on purpose
rachel|and then act aloof

ross|well mr
ross|big shot is better than ‘wethead’
joey|okay some tricks of the trade
joey|now i’ve never been able to cry as an actor so if i’m in a scene where i have to cry i cut a hole in my pocket take a pair of tweezers and just start pulling
joey|or ah or let’s say i wanna convey that i’ve just done something evil
joey|that would be the basic ‘i have a fishhook in my eyebrow and i like it’ okay let’s say i’ve just gotten bad news well all i do there is try and divide by
joey|and that’s how it’s done
joey|great soap opera acting tonight everybody class dismissed

phoebe|they have the best stuff in there
chandler|oh my god
chandler|oh my god
joey|yeah
joey|we figured when we couldn’t find you you’d gone home to make up with rachel
joey|which is probably what you shoulda done
joey|huh
ross|you think
ross|god i ah i’m in hell
ross|i mean what what am i gonna do
ross|rachel’s all like ‘i love you and and let’s work on this
ross|’ and all i can think about is ‘what is she gonna do
ross|what is she gonna say
ross|’ when i tell her what i did
chandler|well before we answer that i think we should address the more important question
chandler|how dumb are you
ross|what
ross|look we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here right
ross|how am i supposed to do that here without being totally honest with each other
joey|look ross look i’m on board about this totally honesty thing i am just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble
chandler|he’s right
chandler|nobody’s gonna benefit and you’re just gonna hurt her
joey|yeah and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild
ross|yeah but don’t you think
chandler|all right look if you absolutely have to tell her at least wait until the timing’s right
chandler|and that’s what deathbeds are for
ross|yeah okay
joey|all right okay now we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way
joey|did you think about the trail
ross|what trail
joey|the trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it
joey|you always have to think about the trail
ross|oh i i don’t think there’s any trail
chandler|okay okay okay ah chloe works with that guy issac
chandler|issac’s sister is jasmine
chandler|and jasmine works at that message place with phoebe
chandler|and phoebe’s friends with rachel
chandler|and that’s the trail i did it
phoebe|after applying the waxine and linen strips to leg number one
monica|did that
phoebe|grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion
monica|okay
monica|ow
monica|ow oh oh
phoebe|was it not pain free
monica|no
monica|it was painful
monica|oh my god they should call it pain zine now with a little wax
phoebe|huh well the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad
monica|that’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid
monica|but hey y'know if you don’t believe me please by my guest
phoebe|ow ow ow ow
phoebe|oh my god
monica|now are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips
ross|chloe
ross|hi

chandler|yeah well i don’t think you can make that statement unless you’ve been kicked in an area that god only meant to be treated nicely

chandler|doug
chandler|i’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself
chandler|no no
chandler|it it’s not about the swearing it’s more about ah the way that you ah occasionally concentrate your enthusiasm on my buttock

chandler|okay

chandler|it just keeps getting worse and worse
chandler|y'know
chandler|i mean it’s bad enough that i’m in love with my roommates girlfriend which by the way i think she knows
chandler|because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us
chandler|and call me crazy but i think she likes me too
chandler|and now i have seen her naked
chandler|i mean at least when i’ve seen her with clothes on i could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something

chandler|wait
chandler|you’re going out with kathy
joey|yeah
joey|why are you getting so upset
chandler|well i’m upset for you
chandler|i mean having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you
joey|what is the big deal
joey|it’s not like we’re exclusive
chandler|look joey kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs
chandler|but casey i mean granted i only saw the back of her head but i got this sense that she’s she’s smart and funny and gets you
joey|you got all that from the back of her head

phoebe|well kinda
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|yeah
ross|pheebs
phoebe|yeah i i can’t i mean y’know i was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it i just i feel so dwarfed by your musical gift
phoebe|i
ross|see but pheebs that that is the exact opposite intent of my music
ross|y’know my music is is meant to inspire and if it bothers you this much then i i won’t play anymore
phoebe|oh no
phoebe|no no no don’t do that
phoebe|how could i live with myself if i knew i was depriving the world of your music
ross|yeah okay

monica|yeah
monica|joey has the best boyfriend ever
chandler|i kissed kathy
ross|what
monica|are you serious
phoebe|does joey know
chandler|no
chandler|is there anyway anyway you think he’ll understand this
monica|you obviously haven’t screwed over a lot of your friends
monica|which we all appreciate
ross|no the the sad thing is if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her knowing joey he probably just would’ve just stepped aside
chandler|oh don’t say that
chandler|don’t say that
chandler|that’s not true
chandler|is it
phoebe|i think maybe yeah
monica|he loves you
chandler|then why didn’t you tell me to do that
ross|well i said i said something to phoebe
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|no that’s right
phoebe|and i thought it was a really good idea
rachel|i know i remember that
monica|i remember you did
chandler|god
chandler|what am i gonna do
rachel|well chandler you’re gonna have to tell him
chandler|why
chandler|why do i have to tell him
rachel|because you do
chandler|yeah i know
ross|hey would it be okay if i wrote a song about this
chandler|hey
joey|hey
joey|samboucha margarita
chandler|is that a real thing
joey|well we only had samboucha so it is now
chandler|listen ah joe i i need to i need to talk to you about something

chandler|i like her a lot actually
joey|you do
chandler|yeah
joey|well you’re timing couldn’t be better
joey|she’s not my girlfriend anymore
chandler|what
joey|yeah she broke up with me
chandler|oh uh when

joey|no no no no it’s uh it’s okay
chandler|yeah
joey|yeah
joey|you know why
joey|‘cause you can to me first
chandler|well i thought that would be the best thing to do
joey|but hey listen just so you know you might have you’re work cut out for you
joey|‘cause when i talked to her i kinda got the feeling that she’s into some other guy
joey|so
chandler|see uh that’s that’s actually what i wanted to talk to you about
chandler|i i think i know who the other guy is
joey|who
chandler|it’s me
chandler|i’m the other guy
joey|what
chandler|yeah i mean when you were late last night kathy and i got to talking and one thing to another and
joey|and what
joey|did you sleep with her
chandler|no
chandler|no
chandler|no
chandler|i just kissed her
joey|what
joey|that’s even worse
chandler|how is that worse
joey|i don’t know
joey|but it’s the same
chandler|look i’m sorry
chandler|but there’s nothing i can do i think i’m in love with her
joey|who cares
joey|you went behind my back
joey|i would never do that to you
chandler|you’re right i have no excuses
chandler|i was totally over the line
joey|over the line
joey|you you’re you’re so far past the line that you you can’t even see the line
joey|the line is a dot to you
chandler|yes
chandler|yes
chandler|right
chandler|and i feel horrible
chandler|you have to believe me
joey|is that why you bought all this stuff
joey|well y’know what i will not watch your tv i will not listen to your stereo and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that i’m not gonna eat
joey|you know why
chandler|probably because
joey|because it’s all tainted with your betrayal
joey|from now on this apartment is empty for me
joey|and i’m not happy about you either
joey|oh and just so you know i made that bread for you
phoebe|oh my god he’s lost it
phoebe|he’s totally lost it
monica|what
rachel|phoebe his music could not get any worse

rachel|so are things with you and joey any better
chandler|they couldn’t be worse
chandler|i spent eight hours calling him last night just trying to get him to talk to me
rachel|oh wow eight hours
rachel|so you could probably really use one of those plug in telephone headsets huh
ross|should we all expect christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office
rachel|you shouldn’t
phoebe|speaking of christmas umm since monica and i are starting a new business and have like no money umm this year maybe we could do secret santa and then we each only buy one gift
phoebe|and and there’s the added mystery of who gets who
ross|who gets whom
ross|i don’t know why i do that
rachel|well i’m gonna take a nap turkey makes me sleepy
monica|we haven’t eaten yet
rachel|i know but all that work you’re doing to get it ready i just
chandler|hey by any chance did either of pick uh rachel for your secret santa ‘cause i wanna trade for her
phoebe|i picked her
phoebe|oh thank god you want her
phoebe|ooh
chandler|wow
chandler|why do you want to get rid of her so badly
phoebe|because she exchanges every gift she ever gets it’s like impossible to get her something she likes
phoebe|come on let’s trade
chandler|oh that’s not true
chandler|that’s not true
chandler|i got her that backpack and she loved it
chandler|i remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it oh there was no big dog
chandler|all right this sucks
chandler|i already got her this briefcase and i had r
chandler|g
chandler|put on it her initials
phoebe|ohh

monica|ooh like ross geller
chandler|op y'know what though it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase
monica|who cares
monica|he works in a museum
chandler|hey what time is it
chandler|the big game is about to start

phoebe|ooh god it looks bad
rachel|honey maybe we should take you to a doctor

chandler|he’s really picky about his patients
phoebe|honey you’ve got to go

phoebe|hi
phoebe|yeah i’m calling on behalf of monica geller’s eye and is um is richard burke in today
phoebe|he’s out of town but does she want to see the on call doctor
monica|yes
phoebe|yes
phoebe|she’s very excited about that
phoebe|this is so cool ‘til monica gets back it’s like i’m head chef and i get to make all the decisions
ross|hey hey i thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly
phoebe|okay get out of my kitchen
chandler|all right
chandler|okay
chandler|i think i am making some progress with joey when i went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once
chandler|i mean yeah he gave me the finger while doing it
phoebe|all right i i gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question
ross|so listen ah i picked monica for secret santa but i’m already getting her something for chanukah i was wondering if you wanna switch
chandler|oh y’know what i was already trying to trade for ah well you
ross|really
ross|wow
ross|that’s that’s so nice what are you gonna get me
chandler|i don’t know r
chandler|g
chandler|i was thinking something girlie for your office
ross|yeah well maybe phoebe will switch with me
chandler|oh no no no you don’t want to do that then you’re gonna get stuck with rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets
ross|oh that’s not true
ross|i’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back
chandler|like
ross|like uh that gold necklace i got her last year
chandler|when was the last time you saw her wear it
ross|well she wore it all christmas day and then uh
chandler|big dog
ross|hey
joey|hey
ross|what are you doing
joey|i’m sending back all this stuff that chandler bought out of guilt
ross|everything
ross|even the tv
joey|no
joey|i’m putting that in my room
ross|listen joey i know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out
joey|back when you and rachel were together if chandler had kissed her would you hear him out
ross|that’s a good point
ross|so uh how long are you gonna punish him
joey|five years
ross|you’ve sentenced him
joey|hey
joey|don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time
ross|joey the guy’s your best friend
joey|no was my best friend

ross|i’m honored
ross|and y’know what i’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend
joey|what
ross|i’m gonna get you to talk to chandler
joey|all right
joey|but if you weren’t my best friend
chandler|i walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me he just mumbles something in italian

chandler|oh uh when when are you coming back
joey|i don’t know
joey|i might stay there for a few days while i look for an apartment
chandler|what
joey|yeah y’know at first i thought we could talk about this y’know work it out but uh seeing you two together i don’t think i
chandler|hey look what do you want me to say
chandler|do you want me to say that i’ll stop seeing her
joey|look it’s not about her
joey|okay
joey|but seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did
joey|and i don’t want to live with some one who doesn’t know what it is to be a friend
joey|so i’ll see ya
chandler|hey look i know what it is to be a friend i just i just screwed up
joey|yeah
joey|you did
joey|and that’s why i’m leaving
chandler|all right look if you’re not gonna stay for me then at least stay for them
chandler|okay they have had a very difficult year
chandler|what with the robbery and all
joey|when that guy was robbing us and i was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours you know what i was doing in there all that time
joey|i was thinking about how i let you down
chandler|what
joey|yeah
joey|but if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be i wouldn’t have worried about it so much
joey|see you around
chandler|all right wait
chandler|come on
chandler|just wait one second
chandler|there has to be something that i can do
chandler|something
chandler|if we still had that entertainment unit i would get in it for six hours and think about how i let you down
chandler|what
joey|we’ve got a box
monica|i was probably waiting for it to open
monica|you look great too
monica|so how does it look
monica|like a pirate
monica|umm so how long have you been working with your dad
monica|come on one of us had to mention him
monica|oh
monica|big family dinner tonight

monica|aye matie
monica|i know
ross|he’s coming here for thanksgiving

joey|ew
chandler|sounds like a really bad idea to me
rachel|is he okay in there

monica|fine
monica|judge all you want to but married a lesbian left a man at the altar fell in love with a gay ice dancer threw a girl’s wooden leg in a fire livin’ in a box
rachel|so now what exactly is the point of the box
joey|chandler
chandler|the meaning of the box is three fold
chandler|one it gives me the time to think about what i did
chandler|two it proves how much i care about my friendship with joey
chandler|and three it hurts

chandler|i can’t believe we live here
chandler|okay she is the star of the play
chandler|and she is my girlfriend
chandler|i get to have sex with the star of the play
ross|people can hear you
chandler|i know
chandler|wow
chandler|she looks great
chandler|doesn’t she
ross|yeah
ross|that is one good looking man
chandler|is it just me or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat
ross|dude
ross|here’s your girlfriend’s button
phoebe|oh hey mon do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school
monica|yeah i think i have some around here somewhere
monica|why
phoebe|well it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive
monica|hey rach
monica|i made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room
monica|if you could just throw your purses at it
rachel|bloomingdale’s eliminated my department
monica|oh my god are you out of a job
rachel|no but they stuck me in personal shopping
rachel|which is just a huge step down
phoebe|personal shopping
phoebe|what is that
phoebe|like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy
rachel|uh huh
phoebe|that sounds great
joey|hey
monica|umm excuse me we switched apartments
monica|you can’t eat are food anymore that that gravy train had ended
joey|there’s gravy
monica|if you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time
monica|that fridge has got to be stocked okay that’s your department now
monica|what are you doing
joey|i think i left a donut up here
ross|hey
phoebe|hey
joey|hey
phoebe|ooh
phoebe|how was kathy’s play
ross|well kathy gets half naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy
chandler|yeah it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me to see it
phoebe|that’s a good idea for a business
chandler|i’m totally screwed
chandler|okay they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me
chandler|y'know it’ll be like so where’s your boyfriend what’s his name chester
chandler|and she’ll go no no no it’s chandler
chandler|and he’ll go whatever
chandler|ha ha ha ha
joey|that that is a good trick
chandler|all right look look what am i gonna do
joey|chandler look they’re actors
joey|they’re there to do a job just ‘cause they work together doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together
joey|i mean just ‘cause it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them
ross|oh oh alec baldwin and kim basinger
joey|tom cruise and nicole kidman
ross|yeah
phoebe|hey mel gibson and clint eastwood
ross|they’re not a couple
phoebe|oh okay i get the game now
joey|okay look look let me ask you a question when they were doing it on stage was it like really hot
ross|oh yeah
joey|well okay so then you’re fine
joey|the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off stage all the sexual tension between them is gone
joey|okay
joey|so as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about
joey|it’s when the heat goes away that’s when you’re in trouble
chandler|really
joey|look you guys have been to every play i’ve ever been in have i ever had chemistry on stage
ross|no
joey|noooo
chandler|so uh man are you gonna go to the play with me tonight
ross|y’know what i don’t know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend
chandler|yeah i know but
ross|oh no no no i’m there
monica|hey
joey|hey mon
joey|want some pancakes
monica|you made pancakes
joey|yep
joey|grab a plate
monica|okay
joey|no no stay right there
joey|gettin’ closer
chandler|okay okay but don’t worry because we also have cereals muffins waffles and jams jellies and marmalades
chandler|which i’m fairly certain are the same thing
joey|listen also we’re uh we’re watching the game here saturday night if people want to come over
ross|oh yeah
monica|oh i was thinking about having people over for the game
joey|oh yeah who’s playing
monica|the players
ross|somebody seems to be missing being the hostess
monica|please it’s a relief is what it is is what it is

ross|this isn’t right
ross|i can’t ask people to do that
ross|would you ask people to do that

monica|she knows about us
chandler|are you serious
monica|phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out

phoebe|oh okay see
phoebe|things are looking up already
phoebe|all right everyone calm down
phoebe|everyone calm down
phoebe|i have something that i would like to say
phoebe|who here likes ross
phoebe|of course you don't like him
phoebe|he he didn't give you any money he raised his own hand when i asked who hear likes ross and he's wearing two nametags
phoebe|i i'll be honest with you guys when i first met ross i didn't like him at all
phoebe|but then once i got to know him i saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous
phoebe|i mean all i'm saying is don't judge ross before you get to know him all right
phoebe|i mean i like all you guys now but when i first meet you y'know kurt i thought y'know abrasive drunk umm lola mind numbingly stupid
phoebe|and okay you guys gold digger cradle robbing perv
phoebe|so i think you all know what i mean
phoebe|obviously i didn't think they were gonna start throwing things
phoebe|i just thought if i kept insulting everyone you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero
ross|oh wow yeah

monica|chandler
chandler|i'm doing this because i'm sorry
monica|do you umm you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry
chandler|no the best reason to get married is pregnancy
chandler|sorry is pretty much fourth y'know behind being ready and actually wanting to get married
chandler|will you be my wife
monica|chandler umm i want you to take just a minute and i want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds
chandler|yeah i'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now
monica|honey

monica|well you're not ready for that
chandler|i didn't think i was
monica|oh my god what would have done if i said yes
chandler|well i would've been happy because i would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that i love
chandler|or you would've seen a chandler shaped hole in that door

rachel|oh no wait pheebs i think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you
rachel|but i'm not sure chandler
chandler|okay how long is this going to go on
monica|well i think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so a long time
ross|this is fun

chandler|that's not funny
joey|that's not funny at all

joey|it it doesn’t
monica|no
chandler|no it can mean anything
chandler|like uh all of the sudden you're jealous because i've become the apartment stud
joey|that kinda sounds like your dream dude

joey|in the dream i did enjoy the closeness
monica|um hmm
chandler|joey look are you attracted to monica
chandler|right here right now are you attracted to her

joey|yeah we could sit in the chair and do crosswords but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like like you guys have

joey|i'll treat you real nice
rachel|yeah well y'know umm no honey listen i think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them but i think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone become their friend build a foundation then you ask them out on a date

rachel|ah first i i would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again
rachel|okay
rachel|umm well first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh for yelling at you
rachel|now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah who did who did not umm yell at you and storm out and i think that's a big mistake and here's why
rachel|i made a huge fool of myself and i came back that shows courage
rachel|when i thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job i said no
rachel|that shows integrity
rachel|and i was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage
rachel|okay umm now i know i already said courage but y'know you gotta have courage
rachel|and umm and finally when i thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace i said no and i was not litigious
rachel|by the way litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against
rachel|so she didn't want to sue him
rachel|don't worry i had to look it up too
rachel|so there you go you got you got courage you got integrity you got courage again and not litigious
rachel|look mr
rachel|zelner
rachel|right
rachel|i knew that
rachel|i really really want this job and i think i think i would be really good at it
rachel|oh

monica|really
chandler|yeah
chandler|i've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before
chandler|y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time i think that's pretty incredible

joey|oh yeah yeah
joey|he's done tons of commercials

ross|yeah well he's not gonna get this one
ross|ben is way cuter than that kid
ross|i mean look at him look at you
joey|that's great

rachel|well umm that one is pretty but uh i just i just love this fabric sorry
rachel|oh what a fun office
rachel|oh no my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke
rachel|and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me
monica|that doesn't seem fair
rachel|i know
rachel|it's like i'm being punished for not having this disgusting poisoning habit
chandler|yeah it is the best
rachel|i mean what if this keeps happening
rachel|y'know they'll they'll be outside smoking making all the decisions and i'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air y'know

monica|well if you're gonna be totally rational about this i can't argue with you
monica|all right
monica|fine if you wanna tell him tell him

ross|rach what uh what are you doing here
rachel|hey
rachel|y'know what
rachel|you are in our apartment all the time
rachel|okay
rachel|this is this is just a drop in the bucket mister
ross|y'know it it doesn't matter
ross|the important thing is that you're here
ross|you're my friend and you're here
ross|oh
rachel|okay just a little scared
rachel|what's going on ross
ross|the most amazing thing happened tonight
ross|i thought my number was up
ross|i had an actual near death experience
rachel|what
rachel|what
rachel|what happened
ross|okay okay we were on the ride along with gary right
rachel|yeah
ross|and somebody took a shot at me
rachel|really
ross|no a car backfired but i thought somebody was taking a shot at me
ross|and rach i i survived
ross|and i was filled with this this great respect for life
ross|y'know
ross|i i want to experience every moment
ross|i want to seize every opportunity
ross|i i am seeing everything so so clearly now
rachel|because a car backfired
ross|okay why are you here
rachel|well i i i don't know how this fits into your whole seizing thing but um emily called you today
ross|you talked to her
rachel|no she left a message
rachel|but it it kinda got erased
rachel|there's just something wrong with your machine
ross|well okay what what did she say
rachel|well uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh she wants you to call her
ross|wow
rachel|now that that was a good thing that i told you right
ross|huh
ross|yeah
ross|yes of course
rachel|okay
rachel|thank you
rachel|thank you
rachel|because i'm sorry all right
rachel|because y'know what
rachel|she didn't want me not important
rachel|the point is i was right
rachel|you're decision
rachel|okay
rachel|i was right
rachel|you're decision
ross|right
ross|i guess i guess i should call emily
rachel|okay no that's not the right decision
rachel|that's not that's not right no ross ross come on
rachel|i mean that woman made you miserable
rachel|okay ross do you really want to get back into that
ross|okay look yesterday i would've even considered calling her back but my ex wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience
ross|i mean that that has got to mean something
rachel|ugh ross
rachel|that was not a near death experience
rachel|that was barely an experience
ross|you weren't there
ross|okay maybe this is something that i i'm supposed to seize
ross|y'know
rachel|okay y'know what
rachel|maybe this is not about seizing stuff
rachel|maybe this is about escaping stuff
ross|huh
rachel|i mean look look today you escaped death y'know
rachel|and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily
ross|that does make sense
ross|because i do wanna seize some opportunity but i i really don't wanna see or talk to her
rachel|well there you go
ross|yeah
ross|maybe today is just close call day
rachel|close call day
ross|hey thanks rach
rachel|ohh honey no problem

phoebe|he kinda did it to himself
phoebe|it's not really a good story
ross|i wonder how i would react under fire y'know
ross|and not backfire but but heavy fire like i was in a war or something
monica|man i would be great in a war
monica|i mean i really i think i would make a fantastic military leader
monica|i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys
chandler|before or after you were shot by your own troops
ross|i know where joey would be
ross|he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us
chandler|yes if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches
joey|yeah hero sandwiches
phoebe|well you all know that i'm a pacifist so i'm not interested in war in any way

ross|on a cat
joey|it's not a cat
rachel|all right listen ball boys
rachel|my grandmother had one of these when i was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing
rachel|i mean it was so cute it would sit in my lap and purr all day long and i would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it
ross|free cats do that too y'know
ross|which reminds me if i might get a little political here support your local animal shelter
ross|pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from you get a much better deal from the shelter plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half
ross|if you want a leash go to the pet shop
ross|if you want the dog for that leash go to the shelter and save it's life
ross|now back to regularly scheduled programming

monica|yeah she didn’t cry
monica|she wasn’t angry or sad
chandler|and you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry
monica|i mean all i’m asking for is just a little emotion
monica|is that too much to ask after six years
monica|i mean what
monica|are are are rachel and i not as close as you guys
monica|i mean do we not have as much fun
monica|don’t i deserve a few tears
monica|i mean we we told joey he cried his eyes out

joey|come on
joey|it’s like the end of an era
joey|no more j man and channie’s
chandler|okay i gotta ask who calls us that
ross|yes
ross|yes second in two years
ross|third overall
ross|basically rachel and i were in vegas and we got drunk
ross|yes yes yes
ross|but i i do not love her
ross|this was just a drunken mistake and i need to get it annulled
ross|i think just the annulment for today
ross|easy
ross|no problem
ross|ooh
ross|there’s no way to do this without her
ross|‘cause i kinda all ready told her uh it was it was already taken care of
ross|uh ha what about someone who looks like rachel
ross|i will think about the therapy
rachel|hey
monica|hey
monica|so um i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff
rachel|okay
monica|y’know no point in dragging it out
monica|dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore
rachel|okay
monica|hey rach what about this
monica|huh
monica|who who gets this
monica|see i don’t know if i want it because it might be y’know too many memories
rachel|what the hell is that
monica|i don’t know
monica|hey rachel you want the big plate
monica|i want you to have the big plate
rachel|wow
rachel|mon thanks
rachel|i love this plate

rachel|you’re not blinking
monica|i’m fine
monica|i just i’m thinking how much it’s an end of era
rachel|oh all right
rachel|but y’know i gotta say i don’t i don’t think six years counts as an era
monica|an era is defined as a significant period of time
monica|now it was significant to me maybe it wasn’t significant to you
rachel|what is the matter with you
monica|what is the matter with you
monica|why aren’t you more upset
monica|aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore

rachel|well y’know it’s you guys
rachel|you you do this kind of stuff
rachel|y’know
rachel|i mean you you were gonna get married in vegas and then you backed out

ross|i i just comforted her as a friend
phoebe|what do you mean comforted her

phoebe|okay just tell me this did you or did you not smell her hair
ross|s s smell her hair
ross|what if i did
phoebe|ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head
phoebe|that’s why that’s why women are shorter
phoebe|so that men will fall in love when they hug them
phoebe|oh come on ross you’re a scientist
ross|i was hugging her as a friend
ross|it’s not my fault her her hair got in my face she’s got a lot of it and it smells all all uh coconutty

phoebe|okay whatever you say
phoebe|but just be careful all right
phoebe|rachel’s not in the same place you are
ross|if the place you are referring too is being in love then she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place

monica|okay i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room right
monica|with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time
monica|and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here
monica|okay whatever i really haven’t thought about it that much
chandler|well i like that idea
chandler|obviously
chandler|i was thinking maybe maybe maybe it could be a game room y’know
chandler|i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh like space invaders and asteroids for the real ones
chandler|the big big ones
monica|no
chandler|okay so you mean no as in gee chandler what an interesting idea
chandler|let’s discuss it before we reject it completely
monica|oh i’m sorry
monica|of course i mean that
monica|interesting idea umm talk about it but no
chandler|so that’s it
monica|i just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room
monica|the beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques
chandler|which is why asteroids is perfect
chandler|it’s the oldest game
monica|what do you have against the beautiful guest room
chandler|i don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room especially since everybody we know lives about seconds away

monica|totally
chandler|we don’t have to come up with this now
monica|oh good
chandler|hey y’know what
chandler|why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room

monica|you’re you’re you’re gonna bring the barca lounger over here
chandler|is that a problem
monica|well it’s a set and they should probably stay together
chandler|oh that’s cool
chandler|then i’ll just bring them both over
monica|see now now you’re taking them away from their home
chandler|okay i get it

chandler|do you know what pheebs
chandler|when you’re done over there we kinda have a situation over here too
phoebe|na uh no we are all responsible for our own babies
chandler|see that’s where i think that you’re wrong
chandler|we’ve been playing these babies man for man we should really be playing a zone defense
monica|what do you mean
chandler|i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone
chandler|phoebe you can be in charge of wiping
chandler|and y’know mon you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around
phoebe|that sounds really great but maybe you should be in charge of wiping
chandler|okay i’m a rookie
chandler|i should not be in the end zone
monica|this is so great
monica|this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|well this is not what i ordered
joey|hey guys
chandler|hey
phoebe|hey
joey|hey babies
joey|oh i’m having the best morning
joey|that uh that porsche i’ve got the keys too still there
chandler|shocking
chandler|since you still have the keys
joey|you should see the treatment i get when i’m with that car
joey|people are friendly they they wanna talk and not just about the car
joey|one guy gave me advice about my equity investments
chandler|what equity investments
joey|the ones that got me the porsche
joey|will you keep up
joey|but i figured if if people keep seeing me just standing there they’re gonna start to think that i don’t own it
joey|so i figured i’ll wash it
joey|right
joey|monica you got a bucket and some soap i can borrow
monica|oh yeah i got soap and sponges and rags and carnuba wax and polishing compound
chandler|you don’t even have a car
monica|i know

joey|why not
joey|yeah so did i
phoebe|i don’t know why i was so nervous about this
phoebe|and i don’t know why frank and alice are always complaining
phoebe|this is so easy
monica|yeah two hours a lifetime that’s the same
chandler|check it out
chandler|check it out
chandler|when the babies wake up they can meet krog
monica|chandler what are you doing
monica|that thing can put someone’s eye out
chandler|he can do more than that
chandler|he can destroy the universe
phoebe|no chandler they can swallow one of those little parts
phoebe|and also look at his smooth area that’s just gonna mess them up
chandler|they’re not gonna swallow anything you guys are being way over protective
chandler|when i was a kid my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass
phoebe|what
chandler|glass sand whatever
phoebe|oh look at little leslie stretching in her sleep
monica|oh it’s so cute
monica|i wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head
phoebe|oh i can still do that
monica|how are you still single
chandler|all right
chandler|i thought about it and maybe you’re right
chandler|maybe krog is not a safe toy
monica|good
monica|what made you change your mind
chandler|i swallowed the sonic blaster gun
phoebe|how did that happen
chandler|well i was trying to prove that i was right
chandler|y’know
chandler|and it turns out i was wrong
chandler|and now it’s lodged in my throat

joey|of course
joey|only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car
joey|right
chandler|that is true

phoebe|they’re gonna triple team me
monica|he’s got something plastic lodged in his throat we’ve got to go to the hospital

phoebe|okay so i totally took care of the babies all by myself
phoebe|i fed ‘em bathed ‘em and put ‘em to bed
chandler|and protected them from a tornado
monica|oh my god
phoebe|i know the babies are asleep
monica|phoebe what what happened here
phoebe|i did it
phoebe|i took care of the babies all by myself
monica|but my apartment
chandler|was the setting of phoebe’s triumph
monica|but the mess
chandler|is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself
monica|you’re right you’re right i shouldn’t freak out
monica|‘cause this is what will happen when you and i have babies
monica|when will that be
chandler|phoebe would you take a look at this mess
rachel|oh honey thank god you’re home i was getting worried
ross|i picked up the divorce papers
ross|uh i’ve already signed everything and i put little ‘x’s where you need to sign
rachel|oh little ‘x’s
rachel|great
rachel|that makes up for everything
ross|y’know i i you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too
ross|okay
rachel|oh name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one
ross|okay how about you flew to london to stop my wedding
ross|ah how about you told me you loved me after i was already married
rachel|hey
rachel|wait a minute
rachel|that was different
rachel|i did those things because i was in love with you
ross|yeah
ross|right
ross|you’re right
ross|that’s very different
ross|so let’s let’s just sign the papers
ross|all right
ross|what
rachel|nothing
ross|okay can we just sign please
rachel|uh hmm
ross|congratulations
rachel|okay ross we’re wait a minute
rachel|umm i uh i kinda have a little confession
ross|what
rachel|well y’know this whole marriage thing kinda my idea
ross|excuse me
rachel|well remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married
ross|yeah
rachel|and uh yeah i didn’t really i didn’t want to say anything but it kinda it just it kinda kept coming back to me and umm remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes
rachel|and uh and i thought it would be funnier if we got married
rachel|so as a as a compromise we decided first to get married and then to eat a lot of grapes
rachel|so umm sorry i got us into this mess
ross|so then if if i mean if you think about it this is all your fault
rachel|yeah don’t push it though
ross|i’ve got to say i know i divorce a lot of women never thought i would be divorcing you
rachel|i know
rachel|i always thought if you and i got married it would be the one that stuck
rachel|and it wouldn’t be a secret and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at pizza hut
ross|did i did i even treat
rachel|no it was on the house it was it was a newlywed special
ross|that may be the most depressing thing i’ve heard in my life
ross|i should probably get these to my lawyer’s office
rachel|hey thanks ross for taking care of all of this
ross|eh no problem
rachel|i’m gonna need a copy of those
ross|totally
joey|hey
joey|hey
joey|be careful around my porsche

chandler|let me ask you why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays
chandler|i remember when people used to use big lights
rachel|that’s a good story grandpa
ross|hey
ross|wow monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree
ross|did someone get her drunk again or
monica|having a perfectly decorated tree is not what christmas is about
monica|it’s about being with the people that you love
phoebe|that is nice and we’re done
phoebe|tada
chandler|i dunno what it is it just doesn’t quite feel like christmas to me
monica|oh here
chandler|see now it feels like christmas
ross|and that’s the story of the dreidle
ross|now some people trace the christmas tree back to the egyptians who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year symbolising life’s triumph over death
ross|and that was like years ago
rachel|so pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story
joey|hey you guys
chandler|hey joe what’s up
joey|i had to get out of the apartment
joey|janine is like stretching all over the place
joey|y’know everywhere i look she’s like

joey|i like her so much
monica|aw i’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way
joey|i know
joey|and she’s so sweet
joey|i just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair
chandler|you are aware that she’s not a monkey right
ross|i am so over janine
ross|i mean yeah at first i thought she was hot but now she’s like old news
ross|hi janine
monica|hold it
monica|are you talking about dick clark’s new year’s rocking eve

ross|you’re gonna be a party person
ross|those guys rock the most
joey|totally
joey|i would love to spend new year’s with you
ross|oh well you see how it works is the part with dick clark in times square is actually live but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time
ross|yeah not a lot of people know that
ross|are you serious
monica|we are there
chandler|what what are you laughing at
rachel|well i used to date him but you’re still going out with her

joey|y’know
joey|but if she says ‘dude what the hell are you doing
joey|’ i can say ‘it wasn’t me it was new years

phoebe|wh wh what are you doing
rachel|we are looking at a playboy
phoebe|oh i want to look too
phoebe|yikes
monica|so do you think that these pictures are are they trying to tell a story
rachel|oh yeah sure
rachel|i mean like in the case of this young woman she has lost her clothes so she rides naked on the horse she’s crying out ‘where are they where are they
rachel|’
monica|well she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that
phoebe|oh yeah
phoebe|aw remember the days when you used to go out to the barn lift up your shirt and bend over
rachel|you see now i would date this girl
rachel|she’s cute she’s outdoorsy you know and she knows how to build a fire
rachel|i mean that’s got to come in handy
monica|okay i’ve got a question
monica|if you had to pick one of us to date who would it be
rachel|i don’t know
monica|me neither
phoebe|rachel
monica|what
phoebe|i don’t know
phoebe|me neither
joey|you forget how many great songs heart had
chandler|yeah
ross|you know barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard
chandler|so you heard it you repeated it so that must mean you wrote it
joey|oh you guys with this joke
joey|i gotta say i know i cracked up but i’m not even sure i got it
ross|what you didn’t get it
ross|the doctor is a monkey
chandler|and monkeys can’t write out prescriptions
chandler|you are not allowed to laugh at my joke
ross|your joke
ross|well i think ‘the hef’ would disagree which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah dollars
chandler|so you stole my joke and you stole my money
ross|well i was going to stick it in the atm but now i think i’ll show the sexy teller that i am a published writer
chandler|well she is going to know that you stole the joke
ross|oh what are you going to do follow me down there
chandler|yeah
ross|well i’m not going to go now anyway
chandler|okay
joey|ah gunther i can’t pay for this right now because i’m not working so i’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh payin’ for stuff
joey|uh i don’t know
joey|ya see it’s just see i was a regular on a soap opera y’know
joey|and to go from that to this i just plus i’d have to wait on all my friends
joey|what
joey|maybe i could be a waiter
joey|could i use the phone
monica|she picked rachel
monica|i mean she tried to back out of it but it was obvious
monica|she picked rachel
chandler|he took my joke he took it
monica|it’s wrong
monica|you know what else is wrong
monica|phoebe picking rachel
chandler|you know who else picked rachel
chandler|ross and you know what else ross did
chandler|he stole my joke
chandler|you know what
chandler|i’m going to get a joke journal
chandler|y’know
chandler|and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes
monica|that’s a good idea
chandler|yeah
monica|do you know what’s a bad idea
chandler|picking rachel
monica|that’s right
monica|did you hear something
chandler|maybe it’s the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts
monica|it’s coming from the living room
joey|i finished my book
monica|hey you guys
monica|oh don’t you guys look cute
monica|you guys make such a cute couple
rachel|monica what are you doing
monica|nothing i’m just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day
monica|remember when you picked rachel over me
monica|that was funny
phoebe|i guess it was kinda funny
monica|it wasn’t funny at all
monica|why would you do that
monica|why didn’t you pick me
phoebe|fine
phoebe|the reason that i was leaning a little bit more toward rachel than you is just that you’re just kinda high maintenance okay let’s go to lunch
monica|that is completely untrue
monica|you think i’m high maintenance
monica|okay prove it
monica|i want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point
phoebe|no okay you’re right
phoebe|you’re easy going
phoebe|you’re just not as easy going as rachel
phoebe|she’s just more flexible and and mellow
phoebe|that’s all
rachel|well people are different
phoebe|ya you know rachel she’ll do whatever you want
phoebe|y’know you can just walk all over her
rachel|what
rachel|wait a minute

joey|i’ll get it for you right now
joey|and since i made you wait i’ll toss in a free muffin
rachel|phoebe
rachel|we would like to talk to you for a second
phoebe|okay
monica|so maybe i am a little high maintenance
monica|and maybe rachel is a little bit of a pushover
monica|but you know what we decided you are
rachel|yes we are very sorry to tell you this but you phoebe are flaky
monica|hah
phoebe|that true i am flaky
rachel|so what you’re just you’re just okay with being flaky
phoebe|yeah totally
monica|well then i’m okay with being high maintenance
rachel|yeah and i am okay with being a pushover
phoebe|that’s great
phoebe|good for you guys
monica|i am not high maintenance
rachel|i am not a pushover
phoebe|who said you were
phoebe|oh i’m flaky
phoebe|i’ll say anything
joey|hey gunther
joey|can you uh can you cover for me
joey|i just got an audition
joey|really
joey|i like your natural color
joey|come on man it’s a great part
joey|look check it out
joey|i’m the lead guy’s best friend and i wait for him in this bar and save his seat
joey|listen listen
joey|‘i’m sorry that seat’s saved
joey|’
joey|okay maybe he’s not his best friend but
joey|oh man i could totally get that part
joey|‘i’m sorry that seat is taken
joey|’
joey|no no i didn’t mean you
joey|but you believed me huh
joey|so you’d hire me right
joey|exactly
joey|all right everybody listen up
joey|the coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour
joey|yeah it’s for the kids
joey|to keep the kids off drugs
joey|it’s a very important issue in this month’s playboy
joey|i’m sure you all read about it
ross|it’s my joke
chandler|it’s my joke
ross|y’know i don’t think we’re going to settle this
chandler|let’s have monica decide
ross|yeah
chandler|yeah
ross|hey mon
chandler|mon get out here
ross|monica
chandler|okay okay
chandler|you have to help us decide whose joke this is
monica|why do i have to decide
chandler|because you’re the only one that can be fair
ross|yeah
monica|i can’t be fair
monica|you’re my boyfriend
ross|yeah but i’m your brother
ross|we’re family
ross|that’s the most important thing in the world
chandler|don’t try to sway her
chandler|i’m your only chance to have a baby
chandler|okay let’s go
ross|we’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth me
monica|okay chandler you go first
chandler|okay i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve
monica|oh wait is he the guy i met at christmas
chandler|can i finish my story
monica|do you want me to pick you
ross|see i would never snap at you like that
monica|continue
chandler|so steve said he had to go to the doctor
chandler|and steve’s doctor’s name is doctor muppy
chandler|so i said ‘doctor monkey
chandler|’ and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up
ross|are you kidding
ross|okay look
ross|i i studied evolution
ross|remember evolution
ross|monkey into man
ross|plus i’m a doctor and i had a monkey
ross|i’m doctor monkey
chandler|i’m not arguing with that
monica|all right i’ve heard enough
monica|i’ve made my decision
monica|you are both idiots
monica|the joke is not funny and it’s offensive to women and doctors and monkeys
monica|you shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world
monica|now let it go
monica|the joke sucks
ross|it’s your joke
chandler|is not
monica|hi chandler
monica|there you are
chandler|hi oh hi
monica|hey it’s phoebe and rachel
monica|um why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance
chandler|monica is a self sufficient together lady
chandler|being with her has been like being on a vacation
chandler|and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and generosity of spirit
rachel|wow you know what
rachel|that is the best fake speech i think i’ve ever heard
phoebe|really
phoebe|i’ve heard better
monica|wait wait he came up with that himself
monica|tell them chandler
chandler|i’m out of words
chandler|should i just say the whole thing again
monica|look i am not high maintenance
monica|i am not
monica|chandler
chandler|you’re a little high maintenance
monica|ahhh
monica|you are on my list
chandler|i’m sorry
chandler|you’re not easy going but you’re passionate and that’s good
chandler|and when you get upset about the little things i think that i’m pretty good about making you feel better about that
chandler|and that’s good too
chandler|so they can say that you’re high maintenance but it’s okay because i like maintaining you
monica|i didn’t even tell him to say that
monica|all right you’re off my list
chandler|i’m off the list
monica|phoebe it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because i have the best boyfriend
phoebe|y’know suddenly i find you very attractive
chandler|hey buddy boy how’d the audition go
joey|not good no
joey|i didn’t get the part and i lost my job here so
phoebe|wow
phoebe|that is a bad audition
rachel|how how did you lose your job here
joey|well i had the audition but gunther said i had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed
joey|so i went anyway and then he fired me
rachel|he left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days
rachel|that’s not that’s not right
joey|yeah what are ya gonna do
rachel|joey you can’t let him get away with that
rachel|ya know what i’m not going to let him get away with that
rachel|i’m going to say something to him no i really shouldn’t say anything no i should say something to him
rachel|gunther i want you to give joey his job back
rachel|that is really not fair that you have to fire him
rachel|what
rachel|that’s right he can have his job back
rachel|i’m glad we got that all straightened out
rachel|there you go joey you got your job back

ross|i guess i i just wasn’t thinking
rachel|yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking

ross|oh wait hold it
ross|but then i started thinking and i stopped the kissing
rachel|oh well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that

rachel|what
ross|no i mean look i don’t know if anything is going to happen with us again

joey|who who’s barry and mindy
rachel|barry was the guy that i was almost married and mindy was my best friend
joey|ohh oh wasn’t he cheating on you with her
rachel|yeah but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me
monica|why did they get divorced
rachel|well apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else
rachel|isn’t that sad
rachel|god could you imagine if i actually married him
rachel|i mean how different would my life be
ross|i know what you mean i’ve always wondered how different my life would be if if i’d never gotten divorced
phoebe|which time
ross|the first time
ross|no seriously imagine if carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian
joey|i can’t
joey|i keep seeing it the good way
ross|i’d bet i’d still be doing my kara tay
ross|towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know not doing anything else physical
chandler|maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara tay
monica|and what if i was still fat
monica|well you wouldn’t be dating me that’s for sure
chandler|sure i would
chandler|what you guys really think that i’m that shallow
ross|no i just think monica was that fat
joey|hey imagine if i never got fired off days of our lives
joey|oh hey there’s carol again
chandler|what if i had had the guts to quit my job
chandler|i’d probably be writing for the new yorker getting paid to be funny
chandler|but my job’s fun too
chandler|i mean tomorrow i i don’t have to wear a tie
phoebe|what if i had taken that job at merrill lynch
ross|what
rachel|merrill lynch
phoebe|yeah i had a massage client who worked there and and he said i had a knack for stocks
rachel|well why didn’t you take the job
phoebe|because at that time you see i thought everything that rhymed was true
phoebe|so i thought y’know that if i’d work with stocks i’d have to live in a box and only eat lox and have a pet fox
ross|hey do you guys think that if all those things happened we’d still hang out
ross|oh my god
ross|rachel green
rachel|rob tillman

chandler|i wanna make sure it’s perfect
phoebe|okay

chandler|hey
monica|what are you up too
chandler|oh just hanging out talkin’ about uh websites
chandler|yeah we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you
joey|yeah big brother
monica|well that’s a little crazy
monica|although i am y’know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the internet
chandler|yeah well y’know it just got me thinking though why would anybody ever want to get married huh
monica|why
monica|to celebrate your relationship
monica|to solidify your commitment
monica|to declare your love for one another to the world
chandler|eh
monica|okay well that’s good to know
joey|the mr
joey|bowmont’s here

monica|oh look i i i’m sorry but umm this this this this is not going to happen
monica|well he is
monica|yeah i mean marriage is all he talks about
monica|my goodness in fact i’m the one that’s making him wait
monica|yeah
monica|why
monica|because of the government
rachel|isn’t it incredible
rachel|monica and chandler gettin’ married
phoebe|i know they’re gonna be so happy together
rachel|ohh i mean two best friends falling in love how often does that happen

phoebe|totally
phoebe|i’m like
rachel|yeah me too
joey|hey uh have you guys scene chandler
rachel|wh no but y’know who did stop in here looking for ya tennille
monica|so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday you don’t really believe that do you
chandler|sure i do
chandler|in fact i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural
chandler|i mean look at pigs
chandler|let’s take a second here and look at pigs
chandler|okay pigs don’t mate for life
chandler|i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports
monica|yeah but that’s pigs not people
chandler|if marriage worked i’d be all for it
chandler|but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is
monica|wait a minute
monica|are you honestly telling me that that you may never want to get married
chandler|well never say never but y’know probably uh yeah never
monica|oh my god
monica|then then then what are we even doing
monica|what is this
chandler|whoa
chandler|whoa
chandler|whoa
chandler|what is all this pressure
chandler|is this some new kind of strategy
chandler|why don’t you put down your copy of ‘the rules’ huh mantrap
monica|y’know what
monica|i gotta go
monica|ugh
chandler|it’s okay i got a plan
rachel|we’re gonna find love
phoebe|definitely
rachel|yeah i’m pretty confident about that
rachel|that’s what makes it so easy for me to be happy for monica and chandler
rachel|it would be nice to have a little guarantee though
phoebe|what do you mean
rachel|well y’know some people make deals with a friend like if neither of them are married by the time they’re they marry each other
phoebe|you mean a backup
rachel|exactly
phoebe|yeah yeah i got that
rachel|you do
phoebe|hm mmm
rachel|who
phoebe|joey
rachel|joey
phoebe|yeah
rachel|are you serious
phoebe|yeah i locked him years ago
rachel|wh so if neither of you are married by the time you’re you’re gonna marry joey
phoebe|yep we shook on it
phoebe|yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal
rachel|oh seriously
phoebe|ohh yeah
phoebe|i think his exact words were
rachel|charming
phoebe|well hey it’s just a backup
rachel|yeah
joey|hey monica
monica|have you seen rachel
monica|or a mirror
joey|this is for my boat pretty cool huh
monica|yeah it’s great
joey|whoa whoa what’s the matter

monica|i’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in a dead end relationship
joey|chandler giving you a hard time huh
monica|it’s not like i want to get married tomorrow
monica|it’s just that i i’d like to believe that i’m in a relationship that’s actually going somewhere that i’m not just wasting my time
joey|well you know chandler
monica|no i don’t know chandler
monica|not anymore
monica|it’s like it’s like something’s changed
joey|maybe you changed
monica|i didn’t change
joey|maybe that’s the problem
monica|what
joey|chandler is a complex fellow one who is unlikely to take a wife
monica|is that some kind of boat talk
joey|i don’t know
joey|i haven’t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet
monica|what does he think
monica|does he think i’m just gonna wait around for nothing
joey|monica face it chandler is against marriage
joey|and and always will be
monica|well there’s some people who do want to marry me
joey|there are
monica|yeah
monica|richard
joey|r r richard said he wants to marry you
joey|and and chandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage
monica|that’s right
joey|chandler loves marriage
monica|you just told me that he hates marriage
monica|that that he’s a a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife
monica|that that he’s against marriage and always will be
joey|you got that from what i said

rachel|so what do you say we make a pact
rachel|if you and i are both single by the time we’re we get married

chandler|i was making a coconut phone with the professor
joey|richard told monica he wants to marry her
chandler|what

rachel|am i getting through to you sailor
joey|yes
rachel|don’t just say yes
rachel|this isn’t a game joey you can really get hurt out here

joey|i want to make a ship to shore call to chandler
monica|all right i definitely taste nutmeg
phoebe|you do
monica|you don’t
monica|well that’s the difference between a professional and a layman
phoebe|that and arrogance
joey|hey
monica|hey
monica|how was sailing
joey|i don’t want to talk about it
joey|y’know you could’ve at least saved me a whole cookie
joey|women are mean
phoebe|i can’t believe that
phoebe|now the only thing left of my grandmother’s legacy is this crumb
phoebe|i wish you a long and happy marriage
ross|hey
monica|hey
monica|how was it
ross|well i had a great time
ross|umm chancy on the other hand
chandler|i will tell the story
chandler|it was going great
chandler|i let him win
chandler|we were bonding
chandler|he even said i could call him dad
ross|and what did he ask you not to call him
chandler|daddy
chandler|all right look here’s the story
chandler|well we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam
chandler|i walk into the steam room and it was really steamy
chandler|so i take off my glasses and that’s when it happened
chandler|guys
ross|over here
monica|oh my god chandler
monica|i can’t believe it
chandler|i know
monica|you gave my father a lap dance
chandler|why do they put so much steam in there
ross|‘cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room
chandler|why
chandler|okay
chandler|why
chandler|wh wh why did that have to happen
phoebe|come on it’s not that big a deal
chandler|not that big a deal
chandler|there there was touching of things
ross|now i know you wanted to bond with my dad but did you really have to bond to that part
monica|listen i’m sure that dad doesn’t care
monica|he probably thought this was funny he’ll be telling this story for years
chandler|i don’t want him to tell this story for years
ross|oh but he will
ross|he still tells the story how monica tried to escape from fat camp
monica|i wasn’t escaping
ross|then how did you get caught in the barbed wire
monica|i was trying to help out a squirrel
ross|you were trying to eat it
chandler|if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off
monica|come on
monica|hello
monica|i’m sorry you have the wrong number
monica|okay i’ll call you later dad
monica|i love you
chandler|all right i’m off to see your dad
ross|whoa whoa aren’t you a little over dressed
rachel|yeah and and you better make sure he tips you this time
chandler|look i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore and i figure the best way to do that is face to face and by face i don’t mean his lap
chandler|and by face i don’t mean my ass
ross|hey are you getting monica and chandler an engagement present
rachel|i don’t know
rachel|y’know they didn’t get us anything

chandler|who
monica|lewis posin
monica|he was my best friend in fifth grade and and then one day i asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no
monica|do you know why
chandler|because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom
monica|no
monica|but because he thought i was too faaaaa
monica|and every time i think about it it makes me feel as bad as i did in fifth grade
monica|y’know i i really think that you should apologize to julie
chandler|what
chandler|are you kidding
chandler|that was like years ago
monica|no i know
monica|but y’know what
monica|it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me
chandler|okay i will do it

joey|this means i’ll never get to sleep with joey

chandler|as bad as that went i actually enjoyed myself
chandler|i think that i’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things i do

monica|yeah
rachel|when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move
phoebe|oh i'd say about a month
monica|really
monica|i'd say to
joey|half hour
rachel|interesting
monica|when it's your assistant i would say never
joey|all right rach the big question is does he like you
joey|all right
joey|because if he doesn't like you this is all a moo point
rachel|huh
rachel|a moo point
joey|yeah it's like a cow's opinion
joey|it just doesn't matter

rachel|have i been living with him for too long or did that all just make sense
monica|please don't listen to joey okay

rachel|well it’s a long story but umm i broke joey’s chair
chandler|whoa whoa whoa
chandler|you broke joey’s chair
rachel|yeah
chandler|i thought i broke joey’s chair
chandler|that’s why i replaced it with mine
rachel|ohhhhh
rachel|that’s how it got fixed
chandler|well what did you think that that elves came in and fixed it
rachel|noo
rachel|angels
chandler|i’m gettin’ my chair back
rachel|what
rachel|wh hey
joey|well it looks like it wasn’t heeled after all
joey|yeah
joey|so i guess this chair is mine now
chandler|joey you broke my chair
joey|your chair
rachel|yeah he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs
joey|so there was no miracle
rachel|no joe no miracle
joey|oh no this is devastating
joey|my faith is shaken
joey|i’m so glad i have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life
rachel|uh huh
rachel|nice try but you don’t get that chair anymore
rachel|all right
rachel|that is my chair now
rachel|you can sit on my lap
rachel|no i take that back
chandler|i think i should get the chair
joey|how do you figure
chandler|because you broke a chair and you broke a chair
chandler|the only one around here that hasn’t broke a chair is me
rachel|no no no
rachel|this chair’s not going anywhere
chandler|well where’s the logic in that
rachel|the logic is that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half
chandler|so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing
joey|that’s right
chandler|what are you guys
chandler|like a gang or something

monica|really
monica|that long
monica|look all you want it’s happening
rachel|no so i don’t have to get married until i’m
rachel|that’s three years that’s three whole years oh wait a minute though
rachel|i’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding and i’d like to know the guy for a year year and a half before we get engaged which means i need to meet the guy by the time i’m thirty

chandler|well whatever it is i hope it involves winking
joey|hey

joey|days of our lives
joey|anyway you’re not gonna believe it
joey|my character is coming out of his coma
chandler|that’s great
joey|and and and not only that i’m gettin’ a new brain
chandler|so great things are happening at work and in your personal life
rachel|wait what do you mean you’re getting a new brain
joey|oh well they’re killing off one of the characters on the show and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body
ross|what
ross|a brain transplant
joey|yes it’s a highly controversial procedure
ross|it’s ridiculous
joey|well i think it’s ridiculous that you haven’t had sex in three and a half months
ross|it’s winter they are fewer people on the street
monica|who are they killing off
joey|uh cecilia monroe she plays jessica lockhart
monica|she’s my favorite character on dool
joey|nice
rachel|she is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces i mean i don’t think i’ve ever seen her finish a beverage
monica|and the way she slaps all the time
rachel|oh
monica|wouldn’t you love to do it just once
chandler|don’t do it
rachel|cecilia monroe man what a great actress
joey|oh tell me about it
joey|and she’s been on the show forever it’s gonna be really hard to fill her shoes
ross|yeah yeah help me out here when you come out of the brain transplant you are going to be her
joey|yes but in drake ramoray’s body
joey|why is this so hard for you to get
joey|i thought you were a scientist
phoebe|rach so that guy there
phoebe|straight or gay
rachel|well i'd have to say gay
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|why
rachel|well mainly because he's kissing that other guy
phoebe|oh no not that guy there
phoebe|that guy right there
rachel|oh yeah he's too cute to be straight
phoebe|ohh knockers will help us figure it out
rachel|all right straight and not subtle
phoebe|ohh he left his cell phone
rachel|oh well we can hand it to gunther and he'll put it in lost and found
phoebe|or we could use it to call china
phoebe|see how those guys are doing
rachel|what if um if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and i answer and we start talking and we fall in love
rachel|i mean wouldn't that be a great story
rachel|kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age
phoebe|yeah that does sound great
phoebe|i'm going to get the phone
rachel|what
rachel|wait
rachel|why why do you get the story
phoebe|i don't know
phoebe|i haven't been out on a date in so long
rachel|phoebe you had a date three days ago
phoebe|that wasn’t a date
phoebe|that was that was just friends getting together having sex
rachel|okay
rachel|okay see
rachel|i get the phone
phoebe|no way
phoebe|no way
phoebe|you just broke with tag a week ago
rachel|yeah
rachel|and until now i didn’t think i’d love again
phoebe|nice try
rachel|oh hey hey wait
rachel|how do we fairly decide who gets the phone
phoebe|i don’t know
rachel|well umm maybe we could uhh ah ha
rachel|too slow
phoebe|ah ha
phoebe|too cocky
joey|that was a great scene
joey|and and and that slap looks so real
joey|how do you do that
joey|oh anyway i just wanted to say how wonderful i think you are
joey|say what
joey|no
joey|no i’m joey tribbiani we did a scene together yesterday
joey|i i’m the guy in the coma
joey|an an anyway i i just wanted to say that since i’m getting your brain when you leave the show i was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
joey|i don’t know
joey|why
joey|did you hear something
joey|oh uh one of the writers
joey|umm
joey|okay
joey|ms
joey|monroe oh there you go
rachel|no phoebe
rachel|you cannot get the phone that way that’s not fair
rachel|okay look i have an idea
rachel|why don’t we why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him
rachel|and then whoever does gets the phone
phoebe|or we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone
rachel|i don’t think so
phoebe|fine all right but i’d bet you’d be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet
rachel|all right first name on the speed dial is mom
phoebe|ohh i lost my mom to suicide
rachel|okay no way you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin
phoebe|did i use that already today
phoebe|i’m sorry
rachel|yes okay
rachel|well now see this isn’t telling us anything

phoebe|fine that’s one for you
rachel|oh i win
rachel|he’s got barney’s on his speed dial
phoebe|so you don’t know that’s barney’s the store

phoebe|who has barney’s the store on their speed dial
rachel|his new girlfriend

rachel|yeah i went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh two months later the couple got divorced
rachel|and now i’m not saying that there’s any connection here y’know but they did tell me that’s why they got divorced
chandler|but i love swing music
phoebe|yeah but the swing kings
phoebe|y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts they just stop living
chandler|look all i know is when monica and i went to see them we had fun
chandler|and there’s another reason too
rachel|well what is the other reason
chandler|i don’t want to say
rachel|well you have to because maybe it’s stupid
chandler|well it’s just while monica and i were dancing to them it was the first time i knew that you were the woman i wanted to dance all my dances with
monica|oh crap
ross|so they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes
ross|yeah

joey|yeah
joey|so uh ross well now why did that first marriage breakup
joey|was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian

joey|like if if they want you to ride a horse you tell ‘em you can
joey|and just figure out how to do it later

monica|okay
monica|about a week ago i was wearing those jeans and i dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch
monica|now when she comes back i will find it and show you that stain

ross|really
rachel|forgot my purse

ross|that was in high school
ross|it’s not like it was binding forever
rachel|okay monica did you know about this

monica|hmm a little relieved i gotta say
ross|look rach i i’m sorry okay
ross|i i was a stupid kid okay
ross|the only reason i joined
ross|co founded
ross|co founded the club was because i was insanely in love with you

chandler|everybody at my school heard it
chandler|you were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from long island
rachel|oh no
rachel|oh my god
rachel|this is all making so much sense to me now

chandler|eucalyptus and chamomile oh
monica|what
chandler|the bath salts
chandler|they’re starting to effervesce
chandler|it’s different
chandler|it’s interesting
monica|okay let’s talk about something else
chandler|yeah
chandler|sure sure
chandler|so what was going on with you today
chandler|oh oh oh
monica|well i actually had the weirdest conversation with joey

monica|what was he talking about
chandler|i don’t know
chandler|joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in macbeth
monica|that was a long night
chandler|all right let’s break this down
chandler|what exactly did he say to you
monica|okay he was talking about rules
chandler|uh huh
monica|umm and looking at people differently
chandler|he didn’t say anything about that to me
monica|what did he tell you
chandler|he was asking all these questions about you me and london
chandler|and of course the glue that holds this all together the rules
monica|okay
monica|so you me and london
monica|looking at people differently
monica|maybe he wants to do what you and i did in london with someone
chandler|but what did he mean by rules
monica|wait a minute
monica|he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in
chandler|because he was looking at her differently
monica|and phoebe is his friend so he thinks that would be breaking the rules
chandler|my god
chandler|he wants to do it with phoebe in london
phoebe|you guys
monica|just a minute
monica|that’s mrs
monica|tribbiani
chandler|you don’t say anything
monica|why would i say anything
monica|that two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives
monica|and they would have me to thank and we could all start having babies
chandler|i’m not going to let you say anything
monica|you just stay here
chandler|oh god
phoebe|oh hey monica i brought back your iron
monica|oh you had that
phoebe|uh huh
monica|i thought i lost it

monica|no
phoebe|well then tell him to stop staring
monica|it’s joey
phoebe|really
phoebe|joey
phoebe|you don’t say

rachel|hey
ross|hey
rachel|you know what

ross|rach i i can’t tell you how how much that means to me
ross|ohh wait a minute
ross|wait a minute
ross|you you hated the name ruth
ross|why why would you change your mind
ross|unless you know we’re never going to have to use it
ross|you did see the folder
ross|you know it’s a boy
rachel|i didn’t see anything
rachel|i actually changed my mind about the name
ross|i don’t think so
ross|you’re just giving me ruth so you’ll get to name it when it’s a boy and that’s when you’ll swoop in and name him heath or blaine or sequoia
rachel|i would sequoia
ross|veto
rachel|fine
ross|unless you anticipated that i would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl and you really do want her to be named ruth
ross|well i’m not falling for that
ross|okay
ross|ruth is off the table
rachel|but ross you want the name ruth

rachel|oh yes i do
rachel|i do
rachel|i believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone
rachel|and do you know how you find him
rachel|you stop looking for him
rachel|that’s why i stopped looking for russell crowe
rachel|he’ll find me
phoebe|uh huh and you

chandler|what
phoebe|yeah i had a date with this guy and i swear to god he is her other half

monica|why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it
chandler|because that's who i am okay
chandler|i'm sure a mature man like richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him
chandler|just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches
monica|is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache
chandler|this is about you and richard
chandler|he's clearly not over you
chandler|he keeps a tape so he can
chandler|look at it whenever he wants

monica|yeah oh my god i'm so moved
rachel|see look amy we're a lot closer to monica and chandler
rachel|we see them every day

ross|rachel and i are bringing emma to ralph lauren today to introduce her to everyone

ross|she's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and a line skirts
ross|can i get a blue bow

chandler|i mean i can write slogans
chandler|i mean how hard can it be right
chandler|cheese
chandler|it's milk that you chew

monica|because your family's feet deserve the best
chandler|honey
chandler|leave it to the pros
monica|i actually know someone in advertising

chandler|oh yes you can
chandler|you just make the faces and the noises
monica|guys can fake it
monica|unbelievable
monica|the one thing that's ours
monica|besides why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby
chandler|that's actually why
chandler|look i'm starting a whole new career now and i'm not saying that i don't want to have a baby i'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while
monica|like a month
chandler|or a year
monica|really you want to wait a year
chandler|it could be less than a year
chandler|i mean you've heard my stuff
chandler|pants
chandler|like shorts but longer
chandler|it'll probably be more than a year
monica|i really wanna have a baby
monica|chandler yeah me too
monica|look i'll just get my old job back
monica|no i want you to have a job that you love
monica|not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration
chandler|i quit and you learn what i do
monica|it's just i think there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby
monica|i mean now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy
monica|there's always gonna be a reason not to do this but i think once the baby comes forget about all those reasons
chandler|i guess
chandler|it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby
monica|it's gonna be really scary
monica|i mean god
monica|when we have a baby there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control
monica|i mean the apartment's gonna be a mess i won't have time to clean it
monica|what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer
monica|messes up all the ribbons
monica|what if there's no room for a ribbon drawer because the baby's stuff takes up all the space
monica|where will all the ribbons go
chandler|should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind
monica|yes please
chandler|oh and i promise i will not fake it this time

ross|some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter the hot nanny
chandler|is this really your long term plan for me to run interference
chandler|because i could get a job any day now

ross|come on man i'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two but for now can you please just do this for me
chandler|allright fine but don't blame me if it doesn't work
chandler|because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something more often than not he's going to have sex with it

phoebe|i don't know
phoebe|they're so perfect for each other it's crazy

joey|these jars
joey|what is it like two bites in here
phoebe|i just wish they'd realise they should be together
joey|i know i know
joey|and when they moved back in together i figured y'know that's where things were headed
phoebe|i know
phoebe|they should be a family
phoebe|they should get married and have more children
joey|yes and they should name one of their kids joey
joey|i may not have kids someone's gotta carry on the family name
phoebe|you know what
phoebe|maybe once they start dating and they see what's out there they'll realise how good they are for each other
joey|yeah because it is slim pickings
joey|i had this date last night yuck
joey|but we should probably keep it down she's still in the bedroom
phoebe|so what are we gonna do
phoebe|are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people
joey|i know that just pushes them further and further apart
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|oh i know what we can do
phoebe|we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates so that they'll realise how good they are together
joey|ooh that's a great plan
phoebe|yeah you know what the best part of it is

monica|i guess you're right
chandler|you guess i'm right
chandler|when we stayed at that bed and breakfast you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window

joey|can't you get on top for once
chandler|all right all right we were
chandler|we were trying to make a baby
chandler|monica's ovulating

joey|i'm gonna have to tell rachel about this
chandler|no no no
monica|no please don't
monica|please joey
monica|she will kill us
joey|hey i gotta

rachel|it's kind of weird talking to you about this but
ross|monica told me you had a blind date
rachel|yeah
ross|i did too
rachel|oh
ross|but is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up
rachel|oh oh no
rachel|do you think she walked in saw you and left
ross|why does everyone keep saying that
rachel|well if it makes you feel any better i wish my date hadn't shown up
ross|that bad
rachel|well he makes t shirts for a living and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this
ross|female body inspector
ross|what size is that
phoebe|now wait a minute
phoebe|so they're gonna name their first child joey
joey|uh huh
phoebe|how how do i get them to name the next one after me

phoebe|oh so they owe me like three phoebes
phoebe|oh my god
phoebe|look it's ross and rachel
phoebe|oh the plan is working
phoebe|don't don't do the plan laugh
ross|the first date we've had in months and they were both such disasters
rachel|oh
rachel|huh
rachel|you know it is weird that phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you up on a date that didn't even show
ross|wait a minute you don't think it was intentional
ross|i mean that's just stupid
joey|we're geniuses
joey|yeah look at them look at them they're really bonding
phoebe|oh yeah they're falling in love all over again
phoebe|oh they see us
phoebe|oh they they look mad

joey|oh and he said that i should think less
monica|so far so good
chandler|honey i'm old
monica|what's wrong
chandler|i am so much older than these other interns
chandler|i can't compete with them
monica|so you're a little older
monica|try to look at the positive you have all this life experience
chandler|yes but i don't think life experience with these
joey|wooooooooow it's like they're on fire
monica|what are they
chandler|they're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can't do because no self respecting adult would ever where these
joey|i give you for them
chandler|what am i supposed to do with these
monica|ah come on sneakers are easy
monica|you wear sneakers all the time
chandler|well first of all they're not called sneakers anymore
chandler|apparently they're called kicks or skids and i think i heard somebody say slorps
chandler|and here look they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around cause apparently walking is too much exercise
chandler|kids kids roll your way to childhood obesity
chandler|would you help me try to sell these
monica|okay have you considered using a girl with huge knockers
chandler|no i don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for
joey|hey that'd work on me
joey|why did i get to buy mrs
joey|butterwords
ross|hey you'll never guess what just happened phoebe and i got mugged
monica|you okay
ross|yah because phoebe knew the mugger
monica|how do you know a mugger
phoebe|i'm sorry i have friends outside the six of us
ross|you wanna know how she knew him
ross|because phoebe used to mug people
monica|seriously
phoebe|well i'm not proud of it but you know sometimes when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff i
monica|phoebe that is awful
phoebe|well ok i wasn't rich like you guys ok i didn't eat gold and have a flying pony i had a hard life my mother was killed by a drug dealer
monica|you're mother killed herself
phoebe|she was a drug dealer
ross|well anyway it was a good thing phoebe knew the knew him because i was about to do some serious damage
phoebe|okay
monica|well this must've brought back some really bad memories for you ross
phoebe|why
monica|well ross was mugged as a kid
phoebe|you were
ross|yeah it was pretty traumatic
ross|i was outside st
ross|marc's comics you know i i i was just there minding my own business you know seeing what kinda trouble got into that week
monica|wonderwoman
ross|anyway i was heading towards this bakery you know to pick up a couple of dozen linzer torts for someone when outta nowhere this with a pipe jumps out and says gimme your money punk
phoebe|oh my god
ross|i know
ross|and and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork i had done for my own comic book science boy
monica|oh yeah
monica|what was his superpower again
ross|a superhuman thirst for knowledge
monica|that's it
ross|well i i better get to class are there any more of your friends i should look out for on my way phoebe
phoebe|no actually you might wanna stay away from jane street that's where stabby joe works
phoebe|okay i think we have a problem here
monica|what
phoebe|well uhm back in my mugging days you know i uhm i worked st
phoebe|marc's comics
monica|yeah
phoebe|well a pipe was my weapon of choice and uhm pre teen comic book nerds were my meat
monica|so
phoebe|well there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said
monica|oh my god
phoebe|i know i mugged ross
joey|i know i'm sorry but can i just have a quick second to run to the bathroom
joey|but i'm bursting with u hu
joey|actually i really need
joey|yes ahahaaa
joey|i think you know
joey|i am what you made me
joey|you know what
joey|i could go right now
joey|i oh i can't
joey|i want to but i can't
joey|i did
joey|sure yeah
joey|i don't have time to say thank you because i really gotta go
monica|hey
chandler|hey
monica|what are you doing
chandler|putting on the sneakers thought i'd get into a younger mindset you know to see if it sparked anything
rachel|oh anything yet
chandler|yes how's this they're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet
joey|hey
joey|probably wanna know what i'm doing
monica|no that seems about right
joey|yesterday at my audition i really had to pee and apparently having to pee makes me a really good actor
joey|i got a call back so i'm drinking everything
joey|oh by the way that egg nog in our fridge was great
rachel|joey that was formula
joey|we gotta get more of that
chandler|you know what these aren't half bad
chandler|you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren
rachel|okay first of all that's stupid and second of all i'm not allowed to talk to ralph
chandler|alright i feel younger already
chandler|yah i think i broke my hip
phoebe|hey you
ross|hey
phoebe|hey how was class
ross|no one ever asked me that what's wrong
phoebe|nothing i really wanna know
ross|oh well uhm there was actually a rather lively discussion about the pleistocene
phoebe|alright nothing is worth this
phoebe|uhm i have a confession to make uhm okay you know that girl that mugged you when you were a kid
ross|wh what are you talking about
ross|it wasn't a girl
ross|it was this huge dude
phoebe|you don't have to lie anymore ross i know that it was a fourteen year old girl
ross|no it wasn't
phoebe|yes it was
ross|no it wasn't
ross|you don't think i would've defended myself against a fourteen year old
phoebe|gimme your money punk
ross|oh my god it was you
ross|i can't believe it you you mugged me
phoebe|yeah and i'm so so sorry ross i'm sorry but you know if you think about it it's kinda neat
phoebe|i mean well it's just that i i've always felt kinda like an outsider you know the rest of you have these connections that go way back and you know now you and i have have a great one
ross|it's not the best
phoebe|i know i'm sorry please forgive me
phoebe|i don't know what to say
ross|there's nothing you can say
ross|that was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me
phoebe|really
phoebe|even more humiliating than
ross|hey let's not do this
chandler|okay you start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes
chandler|he's about my age
chandler|a huh
chandler|so he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control you know maybe he falls maybe hurts himself
chandler|just then a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes
chandler|he jumps over the old guy and laughs and the line reads not suitable for adults
chandler|oh thank you sir or man who's two years younger than me
chandler|i don't know i don i don know
chandler|i was just trying to get into a young mindset you know and it just started to flow
chandler|the cold weather hurts my hip
phoebe|hey ross
phoebe|i know you're still mad at me but can i just talk to you for a second
ross|sure go ahead
ross|whoops sorry sure go ahead
phoebe|i just really wanted to apologize again and and also show you something i think you'll find very exciting
ross|oh my god crap from the street
phoebe|look ross in this box are all the things i got from mugging that i thought were too special to sell or smoke
phoebe|anyway i was looking through it and i found science boy
ross|oh my god
ross|i never thought i'd see this again
ross|it's all here
ross|what made you save it all these years
phoebe|i can't say i just thought it was really good and maybe would be worth something some day
ross|you really thought science boy was worth saving
phoebe|yeah but you should know i also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here
ross|still this is amazing oh my god thank you phoebe
phoebe|you're welcome
phoebe|and thank you for science boy
phoebe|i learned a lot from him
ross|you're welcome
joey|i need an answer
joey|you know
joey|i need an answer now
joey|oh
joey|you knew this all along and you never told me
joey|you never told me
joey|i can never forgive you i can never forgive myself i have nothing to live for – bang – end scene
joey|oh thanks thanks
joey|now i really have to get
monica|wow that's a big cable bill
monica|huh you don't have a job but you have no problem ordering prn on a saturday afternoon
monica|i was in the house
ross|hey uhm phoebe didn't by any chance mention that
monica|that she was the huge guy that mugged you
monica|yah
ross|i see
ross|you didn't happen to tell
monica|everybody we know
monica|yeah
ross|great
ross|thanks
chandler|did you see our bank statement
chandler|can this be right
monica|i know
monica|god
monica|i haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since i was a kid and they came up with double stuffed oreos
monica|what happened to all our money
chandler|i'm not sure what they did but i'm inclined to blame enron
monica|i guess with you doing the internship we're just spending more than we're bringing in
chandler|maybe i should quit and get a job that pays
monica|oh but you're finally doing something that you love
monica|i can't ask you to give that up
monica|though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know
monica|finding gold
chandler|you know what
chandler|you know what
chandler|i think we're making too big a deal out of this
chandler|ok
chandler|so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things
chandler|and maybe we start eating out of joey's refrigerator for a change
chandler|you're chef
chandler|what can you make out of backing soda and beer
monica|ok worse case scenario is
monica|we borrow some money from my parents
chandler|no
chandler|we're not borrowing money
monica|why not
chandler|because we don't do that
chandler|we are bings
chandler|and if there's one thing my father taught me was
chandler|well to always knock before going into the pool house
chandler|but the other thing was never borrow money
monica|wow
monica|i had no idea you had this much pride
chandler|that's right
chandler|i do
chandler|and i'm your man
chandler|and i'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard
phoebe|why
phoebe|oh
phoebe|you don't have to go i have something that will fit you
phoebe|i want you to stay
phoebe|why don't you turn them inside ou
phoebe|i'll miss you

phoebe|there is a speakerphone on the base unit
monica|base unit
monica|think monica
monica|think
monica|this doesn't concern you

phoebe|why can't we just hang out as friends
monica|sure
monica|if you're just gonna hang out as friends then maybe i'll join ya

phoebe|i've missed you too
monica|you know on the way over here i saw this drunk guy throw up
monica|and then a pigeon ate it
chandler|hey ross i just wanted to apologize
chandler|don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me
ross|uhu uhu check this out
chandler|huh
chandler|so that's what i would look like if i worked out
chandler|and was being serviced by a policeman
chandler|you're not actually going to send these out are ya
ross|eh
ross|actually no i don't need to because your little ross is dead joke didn't work ok there were no responses
ross|nobody posted anything on the website nobody called my parents so the joke my friend is on you
ross|nobody called nobody wrote anything nobody cares that i'm dead
ross|oh my god
ross|nobody cares that i'm dead
chandler|no come on you know that's not true
ross|what are you talking about
ross|you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet
ross|i didn't get one response
ross|and i'm dead
chandler|well the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community
ross|i can't believe this
ross|not even my geology lab partner
ross|and i carried that guy
chandler|alright look let's think about this ok do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time
chandler|that people are gonna post condolences on a website
chandler|this is not about people not caring that you're dead
chandler|this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief
ross|you're right
ross|there isn't a decent outlet
chandler|right i mean come on i'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service tons of people would come
ross|exactly
chandler|ross what're you
chandler|what're you
chandler|what are you doing
chandler|you're having a memorial service for yourself
ross|no
ross|that would be stupid
ross|you're having it for me
chandler|ross don't press send don't press se
ross|oh too late too late
ross|it's sent
ross|oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man

joey|alright
joey|fine
joey|it's original hugsy
joey|no now i know that emma wants him but he's mine and i need him
rachel|oh god
joey|she's being unreasonable
rachel|joey there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much oh don't cover its ears
rachel|it's because it reminds her of her uncle joey
joey|it does
rachel|yeah
rachel|and she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much
joey|really
joey|she
joey|she loves me
rachel|oh yeah
rachel|but you know what
rachel|if you need hugsy don't worry
rachel|emma will totally understand
rachel|i won't
rachel|but whatever
joey|ok wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute i mean rach i mean if if
joey|if hugsy means that much to emma then

chandler|i didn't know ross and you were so close
chandler|i'm sure that would mean a lot to him
chandler|and if heaven has a door i'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently
ross|but you didn't
ross|i'm still alive
ross|kori i know this is a big surprise for you
ross|it's a long story but the things you just said really made my day
ross|i mean the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people
ross|did you hear that
ross|kori weston had a crush on me
ross|no mum i'm not dead
ross|i know it's not something to kid about
ross|it was just a practical joke between chandler and me but it's over ok

monica|oh when i was younger i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese and on our wedding night i ate his head
rachel|ok well this is like that
rachel|in no way
rachel|i had a
rachel|i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey
monica|wow do you mean like kiss him kiss him
rachel|oh yeah
rachel|i mean that was pretty intense
monica|what do you think brought than on
rachel|i don't know
rachel|i mean maybe that's something to do with the fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday
monica|a love scene
monica|with who
rachel|olivia
monica|olivia
monica|i thought she was marrying connor
monica|oh right real life more important
rachel|so do you think that my dream means anything
monica|i don't know
monica|i mean you saw him do a love scene so maybe you don't have a thing for joey maybe you have a thing for drake
rachel|ah
rachel|well it was joey reading drake's lines in the dream
monica|of course it was
monica|trust me when it comes to psychology i know what i'm talking about
monica|i took two psych classes in college
rachel|you took the same class twice
monica|it was hard
phoebe|hey
phoebe|here monica look what i got to wear when i play at the restaurant uh huh wait
phoebe|right
phoebe|i mean this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man
monica|oh
monica|phoebe
monica|maybe i wasn't clear before
monica|i really love listening to your music here but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place
phoebe|right yeah ok i'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault
monica|phoebe it's not what you wear
monica|it's sort of your songs
monica|i just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore
phoebe|oh ok
phoebe|fine i'll just i'll take the hat back
rachel|hey so you guys the funniest thing happened at work
phoebe|my songs aren't good enough for your restaurant
rachel|ok we're still on that
monica|i didn't say your songs were not good enough
phoebe|then what's wrong with them
phoebe|would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food
monica|tiny portions
phoebe|yeah well excuse me i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer but i can't see it i can't see it
monica|phoebe it's not about quantity
phoebe|well
phoebe|it's not about quality
monica|oh really you want to talk about quality
monica|have you heard of a key
monica|it's what some people sing in
phoebe|well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic
phoebe|yeah there are other ingredients monica
monica|ok so that's what we're doing
monica|you know when i'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs i'm wearing ear plugs
phoebe|ear plugs or cloves of garlic
monica|you know what
monica|i take back what i said before
monica|you keep playing at the restaurant because with your music driving people inside my bar sales are going up like crazy
phoebe|what are people having the garlic martini
chandler|oh we did and you still have all your lamps
chandler|oh i didn't factor in the room tax
ross|oh dude don't worry about it i found an unattended maid's car
ross|we're way ahead of the game
ross|oh my god
chandler|what
ross|there's something new in the bowl
chandler|look we have enough just walk away

monica|i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall
phoebe|you'd better get back in that kitchen monica the garlic is not gonna overuse itself
monica|ok you have to stop playing now
phoebe|why
phoebe|the only person my playing is bothering is you
monica|oh yeah
monica|ok let's settle this come on
phoebe|get your garlic peelers off me
monica|excuse me excuse me hi i'm monica geller
monica|i'm the head chef here
monica|ok i was actually expecting a little applause there but whatever
monica|ok quick question by a show of hands how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside
phoebe|ok ok how many of you enjoyed the music outside
phoebe|ha
monica|alright let me ask you this question how many of you thought the music was fine but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant
phoebe|ok well who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky
monica|ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone
phoebe|ok well alright who thinks the food is fine the music was fine but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking
monica|excuse us
monica|alright here's a question who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now
phoebe|oh
phoebe|who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great
monica|i'm sorry
phoebe|i'm sorry too
monica|ooohh
monica|hey
monica|wanna stick around and i'll whip you up some dinner
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|as long as it's free
phoebe|food here is ridiculously over p
phoebe|who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me
rachel|hey
joey|hey
rachel|joey do you have peanut butter on the back of your head
joey|oh man
joey|i thought i got it all
rachel|how
rachel|how
joey|i was making a peanut butter smoothy right
rachel|uh huh
joey|and i couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender
joey|and i thought
joey|well
joey|how important can that be right
joey|turns out very
rachel|wow
rachel|definitely just drake
joey|what
rachel|what
rachel|how is it going with drake
joey|oh
joey|i don't think it's going very well
rachel|what
rachel|that scene i saw was so good
joey|well i'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow
rachel|joey is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so i'll give you a compliment
joey|a little
joey|yeah no i really am worried you know i mean i have to make it convincing that i'm in love with olivia
rachel|so
joey|so
joey|i've never played that
rachel|ooh
rachel|honey it can't be that hard i mean you've been in love before
joey|uh
joey|well
joey|just once
joey|with you
rachel|ok
rachel|this could be a little awkward
rachel|i'm just going to blow past it
rachel|well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance
joey|what the hell are you talking about
rachel|alright alright look just uh
rachel|just try to remember how you felt when you were in love and think about that when you're playing the scene
joey|oh
joey|ok yeah i think i can do that
joey|yeah ok there's this party scene coming up
joey|and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her but he can't
joey|and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you but you didn't know so i would just pretend everything was cool but really it was killing me
rachel|joey you never
rachel|you never talked about that before
joey|well
joey|hey you know what else i could use
joey|there's a scene where drake sneaks into olivia's bedroom and she doesn't know he's there which never happened with us
joey|and he knows he shouldn't be there but he just wants to look at her
joey|you know
joey|and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your make up when i would think to myself my god she
joey|is
joey|beautiful
joey|and it hurts so much cuz i knew i could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you
joey|thanks dude

ross|hey how was the met
ross|yeah
ross|joey really knows his art huh
ross|what do you mean
ross|wait a minute
ross|when you guys walked into the met did you go to the right
ross|oh joey joey
ross|but still i mean it seems like you guys are having a great time together
ross|what
ross|what i mean a little but no what go on
ross|yeah
ross|but you know what
ross|i think you should give joey a chance
ross|i mean he's a great guy and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know you can always talk about that with someone else
ross|and if you think about it i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you
ross|you know that's the kind of guy joey is
ross|that was going to be my next argument
joey|hey
ross|hey
joey|you're ready
joey|hey ross
joey|that art stuff worked you hooked me up
ross|glad i could help man
joey|although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be but
joey|i made it work
chandler|it is not okay that i'm aroused by this now
chandler|hello
chandler|oh hi doctor connelly
chandler|no she's not here but you know i can tell her

chandler|well so what does that mean
chandler|ok
chandler|ok thank you
chandler|thanks
monica|hey sweetie
chandler|doctor connelly just called
monica|with good news
monica|of course it is not good news you just said doctor connelly just called
monica|if it was good news you would have said doctor connelly just called
monica|but so what is it
monica|is there a problem uh
monica|is there a problem with me or with you
chandler|actually it's both of us
monica|what
chandler|apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment
monica|oh
monica|what does that mean
chandler|it means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do
chandler|it means
monica|chandler
chandler|it means that we can keep trying but there's a good chance this may never happen for us
monica|oh my god
chandler|i'm sorry
monica|i'm sorry too
chandler|well we're gonna
chandler|we're gonna figure this out
monica|i know
phoebe|good morning receptionist

rachel|yeah
joey|maybe you could take charlie shopping
rachel|oh well
joey|are you kidding
joey|rachel loves to shop
joey|and she has great taste
joey|yeah she's the one who taught me you don't wear white after labour day and that you always always always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes
rachel|ok uh uh
rachel|let's let's shop
joey|ok you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes
joey|and some slutty lingerie slutty
phoebe|ok great

phoebe|that's off right
joey|what's the matter pheebs
phoebe|oh
phoebe|mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight he's gonna be there
phoebe|and she was like oh don't worry
phoebe|i asked him
phoebe|he's totally ok with seeing you
phoebe|so now i have to go so he'll think that i'm totally ok with seeing him
rachel|which you're not because you've totally hung up on him
phoebe|exactly
rachel|and you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous
phoebe|i didn't even think about that
phoebe|aaargh sexual politics
rachel|hey pheebs i'm i'm taking charlie shopping why don't you come and i'll help you find something
phoebe|ok that'll be great
joey|oh ain't that nice
joey|the three of you trying on slutty lingerie together
rachel|that's not what we're gonna do
joey|why would you ruin it who was that hurtin'
chandler|wow
chandler|fortunately she has a very pretty face
monica|oh i so can't believe this
monica|my uterus is an inhospitable environment
monica|i was trying so hard to be a good hostess
chandler|oh i can't believe my sperm have low motility because let me tell you when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places
chandler|hi
monica|hi
monica|ok
chandler|oh damn it
monica|don't worry after a while he'll tune it out
monica|ok
chandler|is that a hint
chandler|because we love you doctor connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child
chandler|wow talking about an inhospitable environment
rachel|hi
rachel|ok you're ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping
joey|alright have a good time
rachel|not gonna find any clothes in there
ross|hey you guys
rachel|hi
ross|guess who's up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference
ross|yeah right
ross|what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract well why are you laughing
joey|just
joey|seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist
joey|it's fun yeah
ross|professor sherman yeah
ross|i've a meeting with him today
ross|yeah well
ross|i think i know how to dazzle him
rachel|oh
rachel|you're not gonna do a magic trick are ya
ross|tsz
ross|no
chandler|hey guys
ross|wait a minute you guys
ross|oh i wanna ask you something
ross|i i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do i'd love for you guys to come and hear me
chandler|i think i can safely say that we all have family issues work stuff and or are sick
ross|it's in barbados
chandler|but you come first
rachel|i'm there
joey|bye
rachel|bye see ya
chandler|ok
joey|all right so
joey|how did it go at the fertility clinic
chandler|not as much fun as last time
chandler|apparently you only get prn if you're giving a sperm sample
ross|so so what did the doctor say
chandler|well
chandler|there's surrogacy but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child she has felt that watching a surrogate would be
chandler|too hard for her
joey|so you're ruling out surrogacy
chandler|yeah
joey|so i don't have to learn what that means
chandler|aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination so
chandler|we're talking about sperm donors
joey|enough said i'm there for you man
joey|where is she upstairs
chandler|ah ha
ross|how do you feel about all this
chandler|i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i don't think there is one
joey|come on ross be a good guy
joey|step up and do it
ross|what
ross|what
ross|no
ross|i am not going to give them ben
ross|the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are are staggering
ross|i mean we've been accepting leakey's dates as a given but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can you can just throw most of our assumptions you know right in the trash
ross|so so what i am saying is is is that is that the repercussions could be huge
ross|i mean not just in palaeontology but if if you think about it in evolutionary biology uh genetics geology uh i mean truly the mind boggles
ross|oh that's not what you want
phoebe|oh i'll take some of that
rachel|pheebs that's for men
phoebe|no i know this way when i go to the party later mike will know i am over him cause i'm gonna smell like another guy
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|ok
phoebe|oh good i'm dating a russian cab driver
phoebe|seriously does anyone buy this
phoebe|i smell like beets
rachel|on melanie griffith in working girl
rachel|i think what you want is over here
rachel|really
rachel|oh i can't
rachel|because i i've seen them
rachel|yeah
rachel|i'm a big fan
rachel|of the movies you know
rachel|motion pictures
rachel|the talkies
phoebe|hey rach will you come with me to a dressing room
rachel|sure
phoebe|ok
rachel|you know that depends on what it is
rachel|i've done a lot of stuff
phoebe|so what were you doing out there do you not like charlie
rachel|she's ok i just don't get a really good vibe from her
phoebe|why
rachel|i don't know you know just the way she waltzed in here all smart and tall
rachel|you know and just swept joey off his feet
rachel|i mean nobody else has a chance
phoebe|who else
rachel|anybody
rachel|you me you know monica's mom
phoebe|you like joey
rachel|shhhhh
rachel|phoebe
rachel|all right look
rachel|i have a little thing for him
phoebe|oh my god
rachel|it's just physical and i have it totally under control
rachel|ok
rachel|it's just when i see them together sometimes i just get a little jealous
phoebe|uh wow
phoebe|isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him
rachel|oh i get it
phoebe|oh well as long as it is under control you know you can't do anything about it he's already dating her and she is a nice person that wouldn't be right
rachel|i know i know so it is just not a big deal
phoebe|yeah
rachel|so can we keep this between us
phoebe|sure
rachel|ok great because i gotta get out of here the smell of beets is killing me
phoebe|oh
phoebe|any chance charlie has a deaf twin
monica|hi honey

chandler|you're both polite
chandler|go to have a seat zack and i'll get you a beer
monica|i got it
chandler|so zack's pretty nice uh
monica|yeah i guess
chandler|so how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his
monica|excuse me
chandler|well we're talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy
chandler|i mean look he's intelligent he's healthy he's athletic i mean he is spermtastic
monica|chandler this is crazy
monica|what did you even say to him
monica|come up meet my wife
monica|give us your sperm
chandler|no i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him
chandler|i mean if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy get to check him out
monica|chandler
chandler|i'm telling you he's great
chandler|i mean even if my sperm worked fine i'd think he'd be the way to go
monica|i'm not going to be a part of this
monica|you can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor
chandler|ok
monica|uh
chandler|zack
monica|tell me about yourself zack
rachel|oh god do you think she heard
rachel|it would be so bad if she heard
phoebe|well maybe she didn't hear

chandler|ok
chandler|i think we've found our sperm
monica|does seem pretty perfect
chandler|yeah you think so well
chandler|should i ask him
monica|no
chandler|why not just because his great grandmother was obese our kids are gonna get that from you anyway

monica|i just realized i don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world
monica|he's not you
chandler|yeah he's better

monica|i mean my feelings for richard are certainly gone
phoebe|you just did it again
phoebe|chandler your feelings for chandler are certainly gone
chandler|i wouldn't read too much into it
chandler|david let me stop you there cause i think i see where this is going
chandler|i'm not very good at giving advice
chandler|so if you want advice go to ross monica or
chandler|joey if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee
chandler|seriously we're gonna do this
chandler|oh because his pens was too big
chandler|oh i'm sorry that's the kind of thing i do
chandler|they broke up because mike didn't want to get married
chandler|hey what if you just let phoebe know you'd be open to marriage
chandler|what
chandler|i didn't mean now
chandler|well you're welcome
chandler|glad i could help
chandler|david i'm pretending to read here
joey|yeah
joey|how you doin'

monica|i don't know what's gonna happen with phoebe and david
chandler|i do
chandler|want a hint
chandler|huh
chandler|i do i do
monica|ok i'm sensing that this is some kind of word play because you are pink with barely controlled glee
chandler|david is going to propose to phoebe
monica|what
monica|why
chandler|be cause we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married
monica|chandler we have talked about this
monica|you are not supposed to give people advice
monica|now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke
chandler|i did
chandler|a pens one
chandler|look just so i know what was so wrong about what i said
monica|they've only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike
monica|she'll say no david's heart will be broken it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again
chandler|man that's some bad advice
joey|oh
joey|hey
joey|thank god you guys are here
rachel|hey
rachel|hey what's going on
joey|everything is upside down here

rachel|open your drapes
rachel|open your drapes
chandler|i'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms
monica|the sun is out
chandler|hey
chandler|remember when i had corneas
monica|ok listen you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs and i'll get the magazines and the lotion
chandler|ladies
chandler|ross's speech is in minutes
rachel|nooo
monica|damn it
ross|walls are pretty thin guys
ross|then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating
rachel|look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan
rachel|so leathery and wrinkled i'm so jealous
ross|finally factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered gigantosaurus argentinasaurus
chandler|not to mention the cold sores
ross|and that's just the herbivores
ross|i'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores their heads are already too big
ross|which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development
chandler|really
ross|but all kidding aside in much the same way that homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus
joey|he said erectus
joey|no he really said it
ross|and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus
joey|erectus
rachel|homo
ross|in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the st century
ross|thank you
ross|oh thanks guys
ross|oh

ross|duh you think
phoebe|okay bye
phoebe|alright so mike's on his way over

phoebe|yeah i can't say that
phoebe|uhm
phoebe|susie i'm gonna be straight with you

phoebe|and he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours
phoebe|well i don't
phoebe|nothing there's nothing wrong with you
phoebe|damn it woman pull yourself together
phoebe|have some pride for the love of god
phoebe|okay not a fan of the tough love
phoebe|but he didn't really know you know
phoebe|he wasn't planning on coming to barbados and proposing to me
phoebe|look precious
phoebe|mike's not worth this
phoebe|you're an attractive intelligent woman and let's face it mike's kind of a wang
phoebe|i mean he proposed to me while he was still seeing you
phoebe|he was gonna break up with you on your birthday
phoebe|and i don't like to kiss and tell but he cheated on you a lot this weekend

joey|hey
rachel|hi

joey|did you tell ross
rachel|well i tried but then he had a shampoo related emergency
rachel|so i guess now it's your turn again

joey|i think it's better if you tell him you know
joey|it's easier for a woman
joey|that way you know if he gets mad all you have to do is go
joey|i didn't mean it
joey|i'm so so ooory
rachel|yeah cause that's what we do
joey|alright alright okay uhm

monica|why
monica|what did you do in the bathroom
chandler|i didn't get to the bathroom
chandler|i bumped into owen on the way and he didn't know he was adopted
chandler|and there's a slight chance i may have told him
monica|oh my god where's my purse
monica|no you know what
monica|i can replace everything in there
monica|get that binder and let's go
chandler|but kids are so intuitive
chandler|don't you think on some level he already knows
chandler|see
chandler|intuitive
chandler|which technically now you should give back
chandler|i'm so sorry but you should have a sign out there or something
chandler|or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door
chandler|owen doesn't know he's adopted and he also thinks that santa is real
ross|everyone

joey|i used the the saurus
chandler|on every word
joey|yep
monica|alright what was this sentence originally

chandler|and that became ‘they are humid prepossessing homo sapiens with full sized aortic pumps
joey|yeah yeah and hey i really mean it dude

monica|oh my god mike was gonna propose
rachel|phoebe that’s huge
ross|well do you wanna marry him
phoebe|yeah i really do
phoebe|yes but after i dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me i don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again
phoebe|i mean i said no in barbados and now this
chandler|she's right
chandler|if i were a guy and
chandler|did i just say if i were a guy
monica|maybe you don't need him to propose to you maybe you can propose to him
phoebe|oh i don't know i don't know isn't that a little desperate

joey|oh
joey|any word on casting yet
chandler|joe i told you you're just not right for the part

joey|rach don't i seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e crap from
rachel|i'm sorry this sounds like something i'm never gonna be interested in
chandler|joe
joey|just watch it and if you don't like it you don't pass it on to your bosses
chandler|fine
joey|thank you
chandler|work joe
joey|damn it
joey|just pass it to your boss
chandler|he's not right for the part
chandler|so if i suggest him my bosses are gonna think i'm an idiot
chandler|and that's something they should learn on their own
rachel|just tell joey that you watched the tape and you liked it but your bosses didn't
rachel|then that way you're the good guy and they're the bad guys

chandler|i'm a pretty little girl
phoebe|i knew it
ross|your ex boyfriend is insane
ross|no i didn't and you want to know why
ross|because your ex boyfriend is still in love with you
ross|yeah
ross|he wouldn't give me the grant because i wouldn't give you up
ross|really
ross|is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review who was the voice of underdog
ross|if you don't believe me let's go talk to him okay
ross|i'm telling you he didn't ask me one paleontological question
ross|oh i'm sorry no
ross|he did ask me one
ross|uhm
ross|how do you spell mboscodictiosaur
ross|damnit
ross|i want you to tell her everything
ross|about the deal you tried to make with me about the crazy questions you
ross|wally cox
ross|that's the voice of underdog
ross|no no no
ross|don't do that
ross|i want you to look her in the eyes and tell her the truth
ross|too little too late benji
ross|no
ross|what
ross|or
ross|sweetie this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable
ross|okay that's it
ross|we are seeing other people
joey|gladys
rachel|ha ha ha third time this week
rachel|man this does not get old
joey|you're mean
rachel|oh don't be such a baby
ross|hey you guys
phoebe|hey
ross|hey what are you doing
chandler|that's funny we were doing the same thing
ross|yeah
phoebe|it's really crazy
phoebe|the hall the dress the food
phoebe|i i had no idea how expensive this stuff was
chandler|yeah it is really pricey
chandler|i mean i freaked when i first heard the numbers
phoebe|so what did you two do about it
chandler|it was pretty simple actually i came up with a couple of cost cutting solutions wrote out a list and monica told me to go to hell
ross|there's no way around it pheebs you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money
ross|yeah and i'm responsible for just like half of that
phoebe|but really it does seem like this money could be put to better use
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|now how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at city hall
ross|i've got to say you guys that's an incredible gesture
chandler|maybe you do that next time you get married
ross|no no no
ross|the next time it's gonna be a hawaii at sunset
ross|but maybe the time after that
joey|hey
chandler|hey
joey|what's going on
chandler|our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment
monica|we
chandler|you know you don't want me to help
chandler|you can't have it both ways
joey|hey is this person who decides whether or not you
joey|get a baby
chandler|kind of
chandler|she's coming by to interview us and see where we live
monica|and it has to go perfectly because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state
joey|hey maybe i should stop by
joey|she could be a soap opera fan
joey|it's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity
chandler|little people
joey|celebrity
monica|ok so i think i'm just about done here unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere like
monica|prn or cigarettes
chandler|what
chandler|no
monica|chandler
chandler|i don't and i'm offended by the insinuation
monica|ok so there's not a magazine under the couch or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank or a filthy video in the vcr
chandler|i'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine but that tape is not mine
monica|it isn't mine
joey|well i guess we'll never know whose it is
phoebe|yes
phoebe|we're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children
phoebe|well i think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one
phoebe|and we don't want any recognition
phoebe|this is completely anonymous
phoebe|mr
phoebe|x and phoebe buffay
phoebe|buffay is spelled b u f f a y
phoebe|sure i so glad we did this
phoebe|it feels so good
phoebe|oh look
phoebe|and we get these free t shirts
phoebe|mhm
phoebe|it's moist
ross|hi
rachel|hi
rachel|emma will be up in a minute
ross|oh good
rachel|oh hey ross

rachel|so uhm
rachel|what are you gonna do today
ross|well i was thinking of taking emma to the playground
rachel|oh my god what
ross|like i said i was thinking of taking emma to the museum of knives and fire
rachel|ok look ross
rachel|i do not want emma going to the playground
ross|be caaauuuse
rachel|all right well if you must know
rachel|i had a traumatic
rachel|swing incident

rachel|and to get me out my mom had to had to cut a big chunk of my hair
rachel|and it was uneven for weeks
ross|and you made it through that
ross|i wonder who's gonna play you in the movie
rachel|ok fine
rachel|you can make fun of me
rachel|i do not want emma going there

ross|you know what you should come with us and you'll see
rachel|ross those things go like miles an hour
rachel|ok
rachel|when you're
rachel|and there is that moment when you are at the top when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth
ross|space is filled with orbiting children
ross|look please just come on you know when you’ll see the look on emma’s face i swear you won’t regret it
rachel|all right
ross|good you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children do you
rachel|irrational huh
rachel|all right well i’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment
ross|oh yeah that’s the same i am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings

joey|i want you to take this seriously
joey|phoebe is very very important to me ok
joey|and i wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her

joey|that was me
rachel|hi
chandler|hey can i talk to you about this groomsman thing
chandler|if you pick ross he'll walk you down the isle just fine

chandler|i'd keep an eye on him
chandler|we have to find out which one the father is
monica|how
chandler|i dunno aren't there tests for these things right
monica|yeah but maybe we're just over reacting
chandler|pff easy for you to say he's a father killer

chandler|we're not very bright
monica|but what if it is better than ours
monica|should we at least look
chandler|what do you think pheebs
phoebe|well i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin robbins

chandler|yeah
phoebe|she died
chandler|you're kidding
monica|that's terrible
phoebe|yeah last saturday
phoebe|wow
phoebe|she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic
phoebe|oh wait a minute i read the wrong one
chandler|oh yeah
phoebe|yeah she was just an agent
monica|joey's gonna be so upset
chandler|i know
chandler|he always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic
phoebe|well we cannot tell joey about this
phoebe|he's already flipping out about everything that's changing
phoebe|this will push him over the edge
monica|seriously you don't think we should tell him
phoebe|well not for a little while
phoebe|let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else
monica|what if he reads it in the paper
chandler|unless snoopy says it to charlie brown i think we're okay
ross|close
ross|ron
ross|uhm well
ross|i'm here to see if you'll give rachel her job back
ross|oh no
ross|at first i have to get you to agree
ross|then we'll see if she wants to come back
ross|look she loved her job here
ross|and let's face it you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it
ross|isn't that true

ross|i see
ross|thanks very much
ross|is this your son
ross|mr zelner yeah his name is ross
ross|what
ross|oh nothing it’s just it’s close to ron

ross|does little ross like dinosaurs by any chance
ross|how would he like to come with me to the museum of natural history after everyone else has left just the two of us and he can touch anything he wants
ross|i just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s not good
ross|let me start again
ross|i’m a paleontologist you’ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones fossils
ross|you let rachel come back and it’s done
ross|yeah
ross|yes
ross|thank you

ross|thank you so much
ross|and i swear your kid is going to have the time of his life
ross|he’ll be fine
joey|hey phoebe
phoebe|hey
phoebe|everything ok
joey|i’m just mad at my agent
phoebe|estelle
phoebe|why
joey|there’s a part in a tv movie that i would be perfect for and i didn’t even be put up for it
joey|she’d better have a good reason
phoebe|i’m guessing she does
joey|well i’m wanna hear it because she keeps doing this
phoebe|well no no wait wait wait
phoebe|all right i gotta go
phoebe|just listen
phoebe|promise me that you will wait a minute before you call her
joey|ok
joey|why
phoebe|because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason
joey|i love that saying
joey|hello
joey|i was just gonna call you
joey|that’s weird
joey|yeah actually i am
joey|that’s it
joey|you know it seems all you do lately is drop the ball
joey|no no look
joey|all i’m saying is that you’re my agent ok
joey|and you’re not getting me into any auditions and i’m tired of it
joey|i’m saying that
joey|this isn't working for me anymore ok
joey|estelle you’re fired
joey|goodbye
phoebe|man tough week for estelle
ross|hi
rachel|hi
ross|emma left her stuffed t rex at my house
ross|you know she can’t sleep without it
rachel|oh well she’s asleep now
rachel|stop forcing that thing on her
ross|ok
rachel|oh you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today
rachel|ralph lauren called and gave me my job back
ross|nooo
rachel|yee
rachel|i mean it was so weirdest thing
rachel|they fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back
rachel|i mean that place must have been falling apart without me
ross|so you’re not going to paris
rachel|no i’m still going
ross|wh wh what
rachel|when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back the offered me more money
rachel|isn’t that great
ross|yeeeah
monica|hi
monica|we’re buying the house next door and we were wondering if we could just take a look around
monica|lady oh sure
monica|i’m showing it to someone else right now but please look around
monica|thanks
chandler|it feels like we’re cheating on our house
chandler|and if we’re gonna cheat shouldn’t it be with like a hot younger house that does stuff that our house won’t do
monica|ours is so much better
monica|this living room is smaller the dining room looks like a cave
monica|what a hole
monica|love it
monica|they could be our neighbors what are they like
phoebe|hey joey want come with me to are you ok
joey|yeah i just i just feel bad about firing estelle
joey|this is got to be killing her
phoebe|no that wouldn’t kill her
phoebe|ordinary embolism might
joey|i don’t know
joey|she’s got to be taking it hard i was like her only client
joey|except for this guy who eats paper
joey|and i’m guessing he eats more money than he makes
joey|look i know she’s not a great agent but she did stick with me for ten years
joey|i’m gonna call her and hire her again
phoebe|no no no
phoebe|don't call her
phoebe|you wait for her to call you
joey|why
phoebe|because patience is the road to understanding which
phoebe|is the key
phoebe|to a happy heart
joey|you blow me away
phoebe|all right so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you
joey|i promise
joey|and that means never having to give a reason
chandler|don't don't
monica|no actually we're buying the house next door
chandler|why
monica|i don't know why
chandler|this can not be happening
monica|okay the realtor said another couple made an offer
monica|maybe the janice's won't get it
monica|maybe the other couple will
chandler|the only way that that is going to happen is if the other couple are the hitlers
monica|okay okay all right
monica|what if we got both houses
monica|huh
monica|we can turn this house into a guest house
chandler|that is a great idea
chandler|and by the way i don't mean to sound distasteful but when did you start crapping money
monica|okay you come up with an idea
chandler|alright alright we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house
chandler|we can still get out
monica|but we love our house
chandler|will we love it so much with her next door
chandler|and she's gonna be louder out here too
chandler|just the crickets and oh my god
monica|okay but if we don't get this house she's stil gonna show up wherever we go
monica|i mean at least if she's here it eliminates the element of suprise
monica|i mean never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body
chandler|well we have to do something
chandler|we can't have her living next door
chandler|oh that does it too
ross|it's me
ross|ron
ross|look i um i now rachel turned you down but i think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back
ross|just hear me out
ross|how would you feel about offering her a raise
ross|perhaps i can persuade you
ross|what if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica
ross|huh
ross|so
ross|we have a deal
ross|yes
ross|yes
ross|oh believe me the ladies they love it
ross|good cause the ladies not so much
phoebe|joey it's estelle
joey|estelle
phoebe|yeah i wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me
joey|ok ay
