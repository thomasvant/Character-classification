phoebe|i’m gonna open up my own massage place and frank’s gonna help me
phoebe|and
phoebe|we can work it around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school
monica|that’s sounds great but how are you going to afford it
rachel|well we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised
phoebe|i’m telling it
phoebe|i’m telling it
rachel|okay
phoebe|okay
phoebe|you know how people need transportation but they also need massages to help them relax so i just figured we could combine the two okay i give the massages and frank drives
phoebe|i can fix up the van bolt the table in the back and you know what i’ve got
chandler|a place where no one will ever get out alive
