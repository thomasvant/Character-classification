joey|y’know you could’ve at least saved me a whole cookie
other|no wait no no
joey|women are mean

phoebe|now the only thing left of my grandmother’s legacy is this crumb
phoebe|i wish you a long and happy marriage
ross|hey
monica|hey
monica|how was it
ross|well i had a great time
ross|umm chancy on the other hand
chandler|i will tell the story
chandler|it was going great
chandler|i let him win
chandler|we were bonding
chandler|he even said i could call him dad
ross|and what did he ask you not to call him
chandler|daddy
chandler|all right look here’s the story
chandler|well we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam
chandler|i walk into the steam room and it was really steamy
chandler|so i take off my glasses and that’s when it happened
chandler|guys
ross|over here
other|have a seat son
other|hey
monica|oh my god chandler
monica|i can’t believe it
chandler|i know
monica|you gave my father a lap dance
chandler|why do they put so much steam in there
ross|‘cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room
chandler|why
chandler|okay
chandler|why
chandler|wh wh why did that have to happen
phoebe|come on it’s not that big a deal
chandler|not that big a deal
chandler|there there was touching of things
ross|now i know you wanted to bond with my dad but did you really have to bond to that part
monica|listen i’m sure that dad doesn’t care
monica|he probably thought this was funny he’ll be telling this story for years
chandler|i don’t want him to tell this story for years
ross|oh but he will
ross|he still tells the story how monica tried to escape from fat camp
monica|i wasn’t escaping
ross|then how did you get caught in the barbed wire
monica|i was trying to help out a squirrel
ross|you were trying to eat it
chandler|if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off
monica|come on
monica|hello
monica|i’m sorry you have the wrong number
monica|okay i’ll call you later dad
monica|i love you
chandler|all right i’m off to see your dad
ross|whoa whoa aren’t you a little over dressed
rachel|yeah and and you better make sure he tips you this time
chandler|look i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore and i figure the best way to do that is face to face and by face i don’t mean his lap
chandler|and by face i don’t mean my ass
ross|hey are you getting monica and chandler an engagement present

rachel|all right
rachel|i did not see the bird
rachel|i did not see the fish
rachel|i did not see the piece of styrofoam that was shaped like mike tyson

rachel|which obviously is an impossible thing to do
joey|all right that’s it
joey|you’re yelling and i don’t see you taking your top off
joey|i quit
rachel|what do you mean you quit

phoebe|y’know i bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe
phoebe|i bet she’s l l lookin’ up at us and smiling right now
ross|looking up
phoebe|oh yeah no she was really nice to me but she’s in hell for sure
monica|well i’ve tried everything
monica|i give up
monica|i guess i’m not gonna be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies
monica|i do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe
monica|kids love that right
ross|aww pheeb come on isn’t there any relative that would have the recipe
ross|what about what about your sister
phoebe|oh no no no i made a promise to myself that the next time i would talk to ursula would be over my dead body
phoebe|and that’s not happening ‘til october 15th 2032
ross|that’s the day you’re gonna die
ross|see darnit i’ve got shuffleboard that day
phoebe|that’s what you think
monica|well i mean what about friends of your grandmother’s
monica|wouldn’t they have the recipe
phoebe|well y’know i may have relatives in france who would know
phoebe|my grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother nesele tolouse
monica|what was her name
phoebe|nesele toulouse
monica|nestle tollhouse
phoebe|oh you americans always butcher the french language
monica|phoebe is this the recipe
phoebe|yes
phoebe|oh
monica|i cannot believe that i just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time
phoebe|i know
phoebe|you see it is stuff like this which is why you’re burning in hell
chandler|so you understand i’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened
chandler|y’know i’m a little i’m a little embarrassed about it
other|i understand completely there’s nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in laws
other|as a matter of fact when i started dating judy i was unemployed and her father asked me what i did for a living and i told him i was a lawyer
chandler|what did you do when they found out
other|they never did so if you ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along
other|shall we
chandler|so i guess we wear swimsuits in here
rachel|well joey i hate to admit it your way of sailing is a lot more fun
joey|yeah yeah
joey|hey why don’t you give a pull on that rope
