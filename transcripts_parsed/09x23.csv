chandler|i do i do
monica|ok sensing that this is some kind of word play because you are pink with barely controlled glee
chandler|david is going to propose to phoebe
monica|what
monica|why
chandler|be cause we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married
monica|chandler we have talked about this
monica|you are not supposed to give people advice
monica|now could not you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke
chandler|i did
chandler|a pen1s one
chandler|look just so i know what was so wrong about what i said
monica|they have only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike
monica|she will say no davids heart will be broken it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again
chandler|man that is some bad advice
joey|oh
joey|hey
joey|thank god you guys are here
rachel|hey

other|that is fair you have had a long trip
other|phoebe i love you
other|i mean i missed you so much these last few months and i thought we were apart for a good reason but then i suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you

phoebe|david so sorry sorry
other|just so i know if i had asked first
phoebe|yeah i might have said yes but that would have been wrong
other|please you do not have to explain

other|and i would not have ruined my career or lost that toe to frostbite
other|it was a good trip

phoebe|yes
monica|because of our meddling
monica|alright
chandler|oh am not this nice

chandler|ladies
chandler|rosss speech is in 45 minutes
rachel|nooo
monica|damn it
ross|walls are pretty thin guys
ross|then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating
rachel|look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan
rachel|so leathery and wrinkled so jealous
ross|finally factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered gigantosaurus argentinasaurus
chandler|not to mention the cold sores
ross|and that is just the herbivores
ross|not even gonna discuss the carnivores their heads are already too big
ross|which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development
chandler|really
ross|but all kidding aside in much the same way that homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus
other|what
joey|he said erectus
other|you are
other|you are kidding right
joey|no he really said it
ross|and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus
joey|erectus
rachel|homo
ross|in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century
ross|thank you
ross|oh thanks guys
other|i thought
other|it was wonderful
ross|oh
