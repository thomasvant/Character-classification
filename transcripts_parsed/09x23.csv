phoebe|really it doesn't mean anything
phoebe|i mean you know monica refers to chandler as richard all the time
chandler|she does
monica|let's get you out of here

phoebe|i keep thinking about mike
phoebe|i'm crazy about david and we're having so much fun together
phoebe|why why do i miss mike
phoebe|that's that's gonna go away right
monica|i guess in time
phoebe|yeah
monica|i mean my feelings for richard are certainly gone
phoebe|you just did it again
phoebe|chandler your feelings for chandler are certainly gone
other|well phoebe's still pretty hung up on that mike uh
chandler|i wouldn't read too much into it
other|still you know a girl calls you by your ex boyfriend's name that that's not a good thing right
chandler|david let me stop you there 'cause i think i see where this is going
chandler|i'm not very good at giving advice
chandler|so if you want advice go to ross monica or
chandler|joey if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee
other|sorry i just
other|i wish there was something i could do you know
other|well you know phoebe
chandler|seriously we're gonna do this
other|i'm sorry uh
other|i just wish i could make her forget about mike already you know
other|why did phoebe and mike break up
chandler|oh because his pen1s was too big
chandler|oh i'm sorry that's the kind of thing i do
chandler|they broke up because mike didn't want to get married
chandler|hey what if you just let phoebe know you'd be open to marriage
other|that's great
other|that's great
other|i i'll propose to her
chandler|what
other|well i was probably going to do it at some point
chandler|i didn't mean now
other|why not
other|it's brilliant
other|goodbye mike we'll see you at the wedding fella
other|well we probably won't invite you to the wedding
other|thank you chandler
other|sincerely
chandler|well you're welcome
chandler|glad i could help
other|how do you think i should propose
chandler|david i'm pretending to read here
joey|yeah

joey|yeah alright
joey|hey hey
joey|you said you're gonna wear a thong where's the thong
other|i didn't mean a thong
other|i meant thongs
joey|you really should have been more clear about that
ross|hey
joey|hey
ross|you're never going to guess who i just saw downstairs
joey|oh
joey|ah
joey|eh
joey|britney spears
ross|yeah she never misses these conferences
ross|no i just saw dr
ross|kenneth schwartz
other|oh my god

monica|i don't know what's gonna happen with phoebe and david
chandler|i do
chandler|want a hint
chandler|huh
chandler| i do i do 
monica|ok i'm sensing that this is some kind of word play because you are pink with barely controlled glee
chandler|david is going to propose to phoebe
monica|what
monica|why
chandler|be cause we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married
monica|chandler we have talked about this
monica|you are not supposed to give people advice
monica|now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke
chandler|i did
chandler|a pen1s one
chandler|look just so i know what was so wrong about what i said
monica|they've only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike
monica|she'll say no david's heart will be broken it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again
chandler|man that's some bad advice
joey|oh
joey|hey
joey|thank god you guys are here
rachel|hey
rachel|hey what's going on
joey|everything is upside down here
joey|it rains all day long nobody watches tv and ross is famous
rachel|alright i don't wanna alarm anybody but monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed
monica|ok
monica|when i go places with high humidity it gets a little extra body ok

phoebe|oh my god mike

other|chandler
other|monica
other|oh
monica|it's the humidity

other|i have a question i was kinda gonna ask her myself
other|yeah i understand but before you do she really needs to hear this
other|ok would you care for my seat as well
other|actually yeah that'll be great
other|that's fair you've had a long trip
other|phoebe i love you
other|i mean i missed you so much these last few months and i thought we were apart for a good reason but then i suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you
other|kinda stepped on the toes of what i was going to say
other|sorry david but she really has to know this
other|alright but after this i want to see you outside
other|if the rain stops
monica|you're the most incredible woman i've ever met
monica|how can i lose you

chandler|i wouldn't brag too much about that thing big guy
other|phoebe will you marry me
phoebe|no
other|um
other|ha ha
phoebe|i love you
phoebe|but i never needed a proposal from you
phoebe|i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere you know that we had a future
other|we can have any future you want
other|ok i'm gonna take off
phoebe|david i'm so sorry i'm sorry
other|just so i know if i had asked first
phoebe|yeah i might have said yes but that would have been wrong
other|please you don't have to explain
other|i mean perhaps if i hadn't gone to minsk things would have worked out for us
other|and i wouldn't have ruined my career or lost that toe to frostbite
other|it was a good trip
other|is it ok if i hug you now
phoebe|yes
monica|because of our meddling
monica|alright
chandler|oh ain't this nice
chandler|it's so quiet i could just lie here all day
monica|i know
rachel|open your drapes
rachel|open your drapes
chandler|i'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms
monica|the sun is out
chandler|hey
chandler|remember when i had corneas
monica|ok listen you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs and i'll get the magazines and the lotion
chandler|ladies
chandler|ross's speech is in 45 minutes
rachel|nooo
monica|damn it
ross|walls are pretty thin guys
ross|then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating
rachel|look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan
rachel|so leathery and wrinkled i'm so jealous
ross|finally factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered gigantosaurus argentinasaurus
chandler|not to mention the cold sores
ross|and that's just the herbivores
ross|i'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores their heads are already too big
ross|which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development
chandler|really
ross|but all kidding aside in much the same way that homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus
other|what
joey|he said erectus 
other|you're
other|you're kidding right
joey|no he really said it
ross|and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus
joey|erectus
rachel|homo
ross|in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century
ross|thank you
ross|oh thanks guys
other|i thought
other|it was wonderful
ross|oh
other|jarvis oberblau cornell
other|i mean the ideas you put forth and and from someone
