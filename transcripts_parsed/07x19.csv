joey|i don’t know
joey|it’s not like it’s p0rn
joey|this is a serious legitimate movie

monica|a lot of major actors do nude scenes

monica|oh boy me too
chandler|y’know i was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…
monica|yeah
chandler|technically we could have s x again
chandler|what do you think bossy and domineering
monica|the wedding is off sloppy and immature
chandler|that’s me
chandler|come on
monica|okay
monica|but wait we can’t
monica|my cousin cassie is in the guest room we’re supposed to have lunch
chandler|well get rid of her obsessive and shrill
monica|shrill
monica|the wedding is back on
other|i thought i heard voices
other|you must be chandler
chandler|hi
chandler|nice to meet you
other|nice to meet you too
monica|so are you ready to go
other|yeah
monica|chandler
chandler|i’ll be right with you
monica|cassie needs to stay at your place
ross|what why
monica|because purvy perverson over here can’t stop staring at her
ross|what
ross|chandler she’s our cousin
chandler|i was not staring at her
chandler|okay
chandler|i was just listening intently
chandler|it’s called being a good conversationalist
chandler|watch
chandler|say something
monica|you were staring about eight inches south of there
ross|fine she can stay at my place
ross|by the way what what does cassie even look like now
monica|she looks exactly like aunt marilyn
chandler|umm so this aunt marilyn is is is is she coming to the wedding
monica|wafer thin ice
joey|hey i’m back
other|hi hi joey
joey|uh so will will i be reading the same scene again
other|actually i tried to call you
other|you didn’t need to come down here today
joey|oh great
joey|y’know i would’ve been perfect for this part but whatever
joey|y’know thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie
joey|good day
other|wait joey
other|you didn’t need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it
joey|and scene
joey|huh
joey|wasn’t that fun
joey|we did a little improv there
joey|yeah
joey|okay
joey|so you you you you were saying
other|well the director thinks you’re really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow
joey|wow
joey|sure
joey|that’s great
other|oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity
joey|yeah
joey|yeah sure just so long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold
other|terrific
other|well uh there’s one more thing
other|uhh uh it’s really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic
other|yeah and so in your love scene with sarah she talks about how she’s never seen a naked man who wasn’t jewish
other|so…
joey|so…what
other|so uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically anatomically not jewish
other|do you know what i’m saying
joey|yes
other|okay
joey|no
joey|what
other|an italian catholic immigrant at this time would not be…
joey|barmitsvahed
monica|so to get this part you can’t be
joey|nope
monica|but you are
joey|yep
monica|but you told them you weren’t
joey|that’s right
monica|wow
monica|wow
monica|and it’s definitely all gone
monica|there’s nothing there to work with
monica|what were you thinking
joey|i don’t know
joey|i really want this part
joey|and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes
joey|like if if they want you to ride a horse you tell ‘em you can
joey|and just figure out how to do it later
monica|joey
monica|this is not like learning to ride a horse
monica|this is like learning to…grow a turtleneck
joey|i kn i know
joey|i know
joey|okay
joey|and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like
monica|oh my god what are you gonna do
joey|i just have to call my agent and tell her i can’t do the part
monica|unless
joey|unless what
monica|well this may sound crazy but there maybe something we could fashion
joey|like what
monica|well i’m not sure yet but umm off the top of my head i’m thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat
phoebe|hey
phoebe|i’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower
phoebe|okay we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone
rachel|okay
rachel|okay
rachel|all right you take care of that
rachel|and meanwhile the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list
