chandler|i quit and you learn what i do
monica|it is just i think there is never gonna be a right time to have a baby
monica|i mean now you are unemployed and in a little while you will find a new job thatll keep you reallybusy
monica|there is always gonna be a reason not to do this but i think once the baby comes forget about all those reasons
chandler|i guess
chandler|it is always gonna be scary when we have a baby
monica|it is gonna be really scary
monica|i mean god
monica|when we have a baby there is gonna be so much that we are not able to control
monica|i mean the apartments gonna be a mess iwill not have time to clean it
monica|what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer

monica|what if there is no room for a ribbon drawer because the babys stufftakes up all the space
monica|where will all the ribbons go
chandler|should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind
monica|yes please
chandler|oh and i promise i will not fake it this time
monica|i wish i could say the same
monica|a little shook up
other|i know you botched that operation on purpose
