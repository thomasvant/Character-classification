monica|it's exciting
chandler|but it's all so overwhelming
chandler|i don't know where to start
monica|hey wait a second
monica|i can help you with this
monica|you just need to be organized
monica|we can make a list of your qualifications and categorize jobs by industry
monica|therecould be folders and files
chandler|hey
chandler|this is where your hyper organized pain in the ass stuff pays off
monica|i know
monica|my erection is back
joey|thank you
phoebe|joey can i have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin
joey|okay
joey| pheebs have you ever been bitten by a hungry italian
phoebe|i'm sorry it's just i'm a little short on cash
joey|if you want i could loan you some money
phoebe|oh no no no
phoebe|i learned never to borrow money from friends
phoebe|no that's why richard dreyfuss and i don't speak anymore
joey|oh hey how about this
joey|wanna be an extra on my show
phoebe|you could do that
joey|yeah yeah
joey|the pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need
phoebe|oh my god i'm gonna be on tv
joey|okay now
joey|i gotta tell you being on tv isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think
phoebe|oh really
joey|no it is awesome
ross|hi guys
phoebe|wow
phoebe|hey why are you all dressed up
ross|rachel and i are bringing emma to ralph lauren today to introduce her to everyone
ross|doesn't she look cute
joey|she sure does
joey|why does she have a pink bow taped to her head
rachel|well because if one more person says what a cute little boy i'm gonna whip them with a car antenna
ross|i think she's gonna be the hit of the office huh
ross|she's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and a line skirts
ross|can i get a blue bow
monica|okay i have looked through a bunch of career guides photocopied and highlighted keypassages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision
chandler|how long was i in there
monica|okay
monica|let us start with the a's
monica|advertising
chandler|wait
chandler|advertising
chandler|that's a great idea
monica|don't you want to look through the rest
chandler|i don't think i have to hear the rest
chandler|advertising makes perfect sense
chandler|sorry you had to waste all this time though
monica|you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time
monica|ooh now i get to use my shredder
chandler|i mean i can write slogans
chandler|i mean how hard can it be right
chandler| cheese
chandler|it's milk that you chew
chandler| crackers
chandler|because your cheese needs a buddy
chandler| a grape
chandler|because who can get a water melon in your mouth
chandler| 
monica|i got one
monica| socks
monica|because your family's feet deserve the best
monica| 
chandler|honey
chandler|leave it to the pros
monica|i actually know someone in advertising

phoebe|i can't do that
phoebe|i'm an actor
phoebe|i have a process
joey|you're a masseuse
joey|you have a table with a hole in it
phoebe|wait a minute i see what's happening here
phoebe|you're threatened
joey|what
phoebe|yeah i'm so good in this scene that i'm stealing focus from you
phoebe|well rise to the challenge tribianni 'cause i just raised the bar
phoebe|come join me up here

monica|you faked it
monica|you couldn't have faked it
chandler|oh yes you can
chandler|you just make the faces and the noises
monica|guys can fake it
monica|unbelievable
monica|the one thing that's ours
monica|besides why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby
chandler|that's actually why
chandler|look i'm starting a whole new career now and i'm not saying that i don't want to have a baby i'm just saying maybe we could wait a littlewhile
monica|like a month
chandler|or a year
monica|really you want to wait a year
chandler|it could be less than a year
chandler|i mean you've heard my stuff
chandler| pants
chandler|like shorts but longer
chandler| it'll probably be more than a year
monica|i really wanna have a baby
monica|chandler yeah me too
monica|look i'll just get my old job back
monica|no i want you to have a job that you love
monica|not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration
chandler|i quit and you learn what i do
monica|it's just i think there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby
monica|i mean now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you reallybusy
monica|there's always gonna be a reason not to do this but i think once the baby comes forget about all those reasons
chandler|i guess
chandler|it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby
monica|it's gonna be really scary
monica|i mean god
monica|when we have a baby there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control
monica|i mean the apartment's gonna be a mess iwon't have time to clean it
monica|what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer
monica|messes up all the ribbons
monica|what if there's no room for a ribbon drawer because the baby's stufftakes up all the space
monica|where will all the ribbons go
chandler|should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind
monica|yes please
chandler|oh and i promise i will not fake it this time
monica|i wish i could say the same
monica|i'm a little shook up
other|i know you botched that operation on purpose
other|i can't prove it yet but when i do you'll be going to jail for murder
other|i don't care if you are my brother
other|i'm not your brother
