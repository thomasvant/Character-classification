ross|wow
rachel|excuse me
ross|oh nothing

ross|y’know what
ross|the doctor will be in soon why don’t we not speak until then
rachel|okay
rachel|seriously breathe louder ross
rachel|that’s great
ross|y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil
rachel|hi dr
rachel|long how are you
ross|oh you’re nice to her
rachel|she has the drugs
other|we’ll do a quick check
rachel|okay
other|so eight days late huh
rachel|yeah
other|you must be a little uncomfortable
rachel|eh just a tad
other|you’re about 80 percent effaced so you’re on your way
other|it still could last a little while longer
other|if you’re anxious there are a few ways to help things along
ross|do them
other|actually they’re things you can do
other|just some home remedies but in my experience i’ve found that some of them are quite effective
rachel|well we are ready to try anything
other|okay there’s an herbal tea you can drink
rachel|okay
other|you can take some caster oil there’s eating spicy foods
rachel|great
rachel|we will do all of those
other|taking a long walk and then there’s the one that’s proved most effective s x
ross|you’ve got to be kidding me
chandler|good job joe
chandler|well done
chandler|top notch
joey|you liked it
joey|you really liked it
chandler|oh ho ho yeah
joey|which part exactly

ross|yeah we tried them all
ross|we went for a walk uh we tried a special tea caster oil spicy food nothing has worked
rachel|well there is one thing that we haven’t tried but someone thinks that that will open up a can of worms

ross|monica
monica|i’m just saying it’s been a really long time for you
monica|i mean women have needs

monica|you can borrow chandler chandler is good
ross|monica what is the matter with you
monica|nothing
