phoebe|yeah um she was 82 years old
phoebe|her name was um mrs
phoebe|adelman

phoebe|i mean she probably woke up today and thought ok i'll have some breakfast and then i'll take a little walk and then i'll have my massage
phoebe| little did she know god was thinking ok but that's it
phoebe| oh but the weirdest thing was ok i was cleansing her aura when she died and when the spirit left her body i don't think it went very far
rachel|what do you mean
phoebe|i think it went into me
monica|god this is so hard
monica|i can't decide between lamb or duck
chandler|well of course lambs are scarier
chandler|otherwise the movie would've been called silence of the ducks
rachel|ok who ordered what
ross|oh i believe i had the half drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim
chandler|yes and this with the cigarette butt in it is that decaf
rachel|oh god
joey|i can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'
rachel|i know but it's just it's the first time and i just don't want her to think that because i didn't marry barry that my life is total crap you know
phoebe|talk about crap
phoebe|try listening to stella niedman tell the story of her and rod steiger for the hundredth time
joey|uh pheebs how long do you think this lady'll be with us
phoebe|i don't know
phoebe|i mean she obviously has some kind of unfinished business
phoebe|sit up
other|there she is
rachel|mom
other|sweetie
other|so this is where you work
other|oh it's wonderful
other|is it a living room
other|is it a restaurant
other|who can tell
other|but i guess that's the fun
rachel|pretty much
other|monica
other|you look gorgeous
other|last time i saw you it was eat or be eaten
rachel|this is joey and phoebe and this is chandler and you remember ross
other|oh hello ross
ross|hi mrs
ross|green
other|so what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job
rachel|oh mom
other|if you didn't pour the coffee no one would have anything to drink
chandler|believe me sometimes that happens
other|this is just so exciting
other|you know i never worked
other|i went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house
other|i am just so proud of you
rachel|really
other|yes
phoebe|i know who it is you remind me of
phoebe|evelyn dermer
phoebe|'course that's before she got the lousy face lift
phoebe|now she looks like soupy sales
joey|pheebs who's evelyn dermer
phoebe|i don't know
phoebe|who's soupy sales
other|oh my god there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello
rachel|yeah well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument
other|you have some life here sweetie
rachel|i know
rachel|and mom i realize you and daddy were upset when i didn't marry barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything but this is just so much better for me you know
other|i do
other|you didn't love barry
other|and i've never seen you this happy
other|i look at you and i think oh this is what i want
rachel|for
rachel|me
other|well not just for you
rachel|well what do you mean
other|i'm uh considering leaving your father
monica|all right
monica|tell me if this is too cute

ross|and you had no idea they weren't getting along
rachel|none
joey|they didn't fight a lot
rachel|no
rachel|they didn't even talk to each other
rachel|god how was i supposed to know they were having problems
phoebe|in my day divorce was not an option
joey|hey look who's up
rachel|i just can't believe this is happening
rachel|i mean when i was little everybody's parents were getting divorced
rachel|i just figured as a grownup i wouldn't have to worry about this
monica|is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering
monica|i mean she's doing it because she wants to be more like you
rachel|well then you know couldn't she have just copied my haircut
chandler|you know it's funny when my parents got divorced they sent me to this shrink and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves
chandler|but in your case it's actually kinda true
phoebe|that's him
chandler|damn
chandler|my mail order grandfather hasn't come yet
other|phoebe
phoebe|yes hi mr
phoebe|adelman

phoebe|um do you wanna sit
other|oh no please i spent most of mid morning trying to stand up
other|now uh what can i do for you my dear
phoebe|i don't know how to say this but i think when your wife's spirit left her body it um kind of stuck around in me
other|you're saying my wife is in you
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|ok you don't have to believe me but um can you think of any unfinished business she might have had like any reason she'd be hanging around
other|well i don't know what to tell you dear
other|the only thing i can think of is that she always used to say that before she died she wanted to see everything
phoebe|everything
other|everything
phoebe|whoa that's a lot of stuff
other|oh wait i remember she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time
phoebe|i'm sorry there's laughing in my head
other|worth a shot huh
