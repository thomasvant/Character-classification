other|you went out with her
other|we had a pact
ross|that was in high school
ross|it’s not like it was binding forever
other|then why did it have the word eternity in it
rachel|okay monica did you know about this
monica|i swear i didn’t
monica|hey
monica|is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door
other|yeah
monica|hmm a little relieved i gotta say
ross|look rach i i’m sorry okay
ross|i i was a stupid kid okay
ross|the only reason i joined
other|co founded
ross|co founded
ross|co founded the club was because i was insanely in love with you
ross|obviously i didn’t handle it very well
ross|but if you think about it the i hate rachel club was really the i love rachel club
other|uh except that it was really the i hate rachel club
rachel|okay
rachel|so what
rachel|you guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me

phoebe|oh come on will
phoebe|just take off your shirt and tell us
rachel|ross
ross|it was no big deal
ross|we we said that the rumor was that umm you had both male and female reproductive parts

chandler|everybody at my school heard it
chandler|you were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from long island
rachel|oh no
rachel|oh my god
rachel|this is all making so much sense to me now
