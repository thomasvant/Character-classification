ross|i think he's been relaxing enough thanks to you and fireball
joey|dude if you think fireball's relaxing you've obviously have never played

chandler|okay it's not his fault that you're unemployed
ross|i am not unemployed
ross|i'm on sabbatical
joey|come on look guys don't fight
ross|and the reason i'm doing this is because i am joey's friend
ross|and if you were a good friend you'd be doing the same thing
chandler|oh so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk
ross|if it does
ross|then you're an amazing friend of mine
