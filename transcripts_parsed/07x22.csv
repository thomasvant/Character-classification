phoebe|okay monica rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding

ross|only way to fly
rachel|come on ross give me the keys
rachel|monica does not know what she’s talking about

ross|no way
rachel|well no brush
ross|fine
ross|y’know what
ross|it doesn’t matter because if i remember correctly there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom
rachel|alimony
monica|chandler we still haven’t gotten an rsvp from your dad
chandler|oh
chandler|right
chandler|umm maybe that’s because i didn’t send him an invitation
monica|chandler
monica|he’s your father he should be at the wedding
chandler|i don’t even know the man
chandler|okay
chandler|we’re not that close
chandler|i haven’t seen him in years
monica|well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked
chandler|well he doesn’t have to know
chandler|it’s not like we run in the same circles
chandler|i hang out with you guys and he stars in a drag show in vegas
phoebe|ooh i think i wanna trade circles
chandler|trust me you don’t want him there either
chandler|okay
chandler|nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back less dress
monica|so what
monica|as long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil i don’t care
phoebe|okay i think i need to do some shopping
rachel|ahhh
rachel|ooh nice
rachel|my god
ross|what do you think you’re doing
rachel|just washing the windshield
ross|there is no way i am letting you drive this car
ross|so why don’t you just hand over the keys
rachel|oh
other|she puts the key into the ignition which is on the left side of the steering wheel
other|does anyone know why that is
other|it’s a tradition left over from porsche’s racing history
other|the world’s greatest endurance race is the 24 hours of lemans
other|which is in france and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on sunday
other|in the 60s lemans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track
other|at the start of the race the drivers would run across the track get in the car buckle up start the car and drive off
other|porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took
other|since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat belts put the car in gear and start it
other|the driver’s left hand did nothing
other|porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24 hour race moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat belts with his right hand
other|that’s why every porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel
other| 
ross|no ah ah ah
ross|do not start this car
ross|okay
ross|okay
ross|i will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now
rachel|look ross if you’re so freaked out just get in the car
ross|with you
ross|yeah right
