ross|y’know when i was over there and she was running around with her friends i felt like i was a baby sitter
ross|i finally started to see what you guys were talking about
ross|i don’t know what to do

monica|well that’s a little crazy
monica|although i am y’know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the internet
chandler|yeah well… y’know it just got me thinking though why would anybody ever want to get married huh
monica|why
monica|to celebrate your relationship

other|i still love you
other|and i know i probably shouldn’t even be here telling you this i mean you’re with chandler a guy i really like and if you say he’s straight i’ll believe you
other|after seeing ya the other night i knew if i didn’t tell ya i’d regret it for the rest of my life
other|letting you go was the stupidest thing i ever did
monica|y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here
other|well yeah i’m sorry
other|i know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but i had to tell ya
other|i wanna spend my life with you

monica|well he is
monica|yeah i mean marriage is all he talks about
monica|my goodness in fact i’m the one that’s making him wait
other|you are
monica|yeah
other|why
monica|why
monica|because of the government
rachel|isn’t it incredible
rachel|monica and chandler gettin’ married
phoebe|i know they’re gonna be so happy together
rachel|ohh… i mean two best friends falling in love how often does that happen
phoebe|not that often
rachel|no
rachel|i’m so happy for them
phoebe|me too
phoebe|so happy for them
rachel|i’m so happy and not at all jealous
phoebe|oh no
phoebe|no god definitely not jealous
rachel|i mean i’m probably 98 happy maybe 2 jealous
rachel|and i mean what’s 2 
rachel|that’s nothing
phoebe|totally
phoebe|i’m like 90 10
rachel|yeah me too
joey|hey uh have you guys scene chandler
rachel|wh no but y’know who did stop in here looking for ya tennille
monica|so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday you don’t really believe that do you
chandler|sure i do
chandler|in fact i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural
chandler|i mean look at pigs
chandler|let’s take a second here and look at pigs
chandler|okay pigs don’t mate for life
chandler|i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports
monica|yeah but that’s pigs not people
chandler|if marriage worked i’d be all for it
chandler|but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is
chandler|97 
monica|wait a minute
monica|are you honestly telling me that that you may never want to get married
chandler|well never say never but y’know probably uh yeah never
monica|oh my god
monica|then then then what are we even doing
monica|what is this
chandler|whoa
chandler|whoa
chandler|whoa
chandler|what is all this pressure
chandler|is this some new kind of strategy
chandler|why don’t you put down your copy of ‘the rules’ huh mantrap
monica|y’know what
monica|i gotta go
monica|ugh
chandler|it’s okay i got a plan
rachel|we’re gonna find love
phoebe|definitely
rachel|yeah i’m pretty confident about that
rachel|that’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80 happy for monica and chandler
rachel|it would be nice to have a little guarantee though
phoebe|what do you mean
rachel|well y’know some people make deals with a friend like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40 they marry each other
phoebe|you mean a backup
rachel|exactly
phoebe|yeah yeah i got that
rachel|you do
phoebe|hm mmm
rachel|who
phoebe|joey
rachel|joey
phoebe|yeah
rachel|are you serious
phoebe|yeah i locked him years ago
rachel|wh… so… if neither of you are married by the time you’re 40 you’re gonna marry joey
phoebe|yep we shook on it
phoebe|yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal
rachel|oh seriously
phoebe|ohh yeah
phoebe|i think his exact words were…
rachel|charming
phoebe|well hey it’s just a backup
rachel|yeah
joey|hey monica
monica|have you seen rachel
monica|or a mirror
joey|this is for my boat pretty cool huh
monica|yeah it’s great
joey|whoa whoa what’s the matter
joey|talk to the captain
monica|i’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in a dead end relationship
joey|chandler giving you a hard time huh
monica|it’s not like i want to get married tomorrow
monica|it’s just that i i’d like to believe that i’m in a relationship that’s actually going somewhere that i’m not just wasting my time
joey|well you know chandler
monica|no i don’t know chandler
monica|not anymore
monica|it’s like it’s like something’s changed
joey|maybe you changed
monica|i didn’t change
joey|maybe that’s the problem
monica|what
joey|chandler is a complex fellow one who is unlikely to take a wife
monica|is that some kind of boat talk
joey|i don’t know
joey|i haven’t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet
monica|what does he think
monica|does he think i’m just gonna wait around for nothing
joey|monica face it chandler is against marriage
joey|and and always will be
monica|well there’s some people who do want to marry me
joey|there are
monica|yeah
monica|richard
joey|r r richard said he wants to marry you
joey|and and chandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage
monica|that’s right
joey|chandler loves marriage
monica|you just told me that he hates marriage
monica|that that he’s a a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife
monica|that that he’s against marriage and always will be
joey|you got that from what i said
other|when the cretaceous period ended the dinosaurs were gone
ross|what happened you guys
ross|rach
rachel|hey you
ross|hey come on in
rachel|oh thank you
rachel|hey y’know i’m so sorry to hear about you and elizabeth
ross|oh thanks
ross|yeah i really thought we’d be able to make it work but uh i guess it just wasn’t meant to be
rachel|yeah love
rachel|it’s a tricky business isn’t it
ross|i guess so
rachel|so what do you say we make a pact
rachel|if you and i are both single by the time we’re 40 we get married
rachel|i mean we know each other we like each other and we’ve we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises there
rachel|you know what i mean
rachel|no like what’s that
rachel| 
ross|right
ross|ohh
ross|you you want me to be your backup
rachel|exactly
ross|ohh yeah i already have one
rachel|what

ross|phoebe
rachel|phoebe
rachel|wait a but but she just she said that joey was her backup
ross|ohh i don’t think so
rachel|ross
rachel|i just had a conversation with her and she said that she and joey made a deal
ross|that’s impossible
ross|i mean we have had a deal for years
ross|we we we shook on it although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that
joey|where the hell have you been
chandler|i was making a coconut phone with the professor
joey|richard told monica he wants to marry her
chandler|what
joey|yeah
joey|yeah i’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe i would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn’t keep flying off
