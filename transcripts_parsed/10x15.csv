chandler|is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes
ross|i don't know
ross|i could talk to her boss
ross|yeah

monica|all right
monica|the house next door to the one that we're buying in westchester
monica|just went on the market
monica|i wanna take a look at it but chandler doesn't
chandler|we close escrow tomorrow so seeing another house can only confuse us and we're easily confused
chandler|we're not very bright
monica|but what if it is better than ours
monica|should we at least look
chandler|what do you think pheebs
phoebe|well i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin robbins
phoebe|anyway

chandler|yeah
phoebe|she died
chandler|you're kidding
monica|that's terrible

phoebe|oh wait a minute i read the wrong one
chandler|oh yeah
phoebe|yeah she was just an agent
monica|joey's gonna be so upset
chandler|i know
chandler| he always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic
phoebe|well we cannot tell joey about this
phoebe|he's already flipping out about everything that's changing
phoebe|this will push him over the edge
monica|seriously you don't think we should tell him
phoebe|well not for a little while
phoebe|let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else
monica|what if he reads it in the paper
chandler|unless snoopy says it to charlie brown i think we're okay
other|may i help you
other|ross yeah i'm a friend of rachel green's
other|uhm actually we met at the christmas party about two years ago
other|oh right uhm don

ross|uhm well
ross|i'm here to see if you'll give rachel her job back
other|ah did she ask you to come here and do this
ross|oh no
ross|at first i have to get you to agree
ross|then we'll see if she wants to come back
other|wow that is tempting
ross|look she loved her job here
ross|and let's face it you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it
ross|isn't that true
other|she is good
ross|huh i took a shot there
other|but i'm sorry
other|there's nothing i can do
other|ah it's not true there is
other|nothing i want to do
ross|i see
ross|thanks very much
ross|is this your son
ross|mr zelner yeah his name is ross
ross|what
ross|oh nothing it’s just it’s close to ron
ross|does he
ross|does little ross like dinosaurs by any chance
other|yeah they're all he talks about why
ross|how would he like to come with me to the museum of natural history after everyone else has left just the two of us and he can touch anything he wants
ross|i just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s not good
ross|let me start again
ross|i’m a paleontologist you’ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils
other|you can really arrange that
ross|you let rachel come back and it’s done
other|well i guess having rachel back wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world
ross|yeah
ross|yes
ross|thank you
ross|this is great
ross|thank you so much
ross|and i swear your kid is going to have the time of his life
other|that’s great
other|i worry about little ross
other|he’s always reading he's collecting rocks and he’s obsessed with dinosaurs
ross|he’ll be fine
joey|hey phoebe
phoebe|hey
phoebe|everything ok
joey|i’m just mad at my agent
phoebe|estelle
phoebe|why
joey|there’s a part in a tv movie that i would be perfect for and i didn’t even be put up for it
joey|she’d better have a good reason
phoebe|i’m guessing she does
joey|well i’m wanna hear it because she keeps doing this
phoebe|well no no wait wait wait
phoebe|all right i gotta go
phoebe|just listen
phoebe|promise me that you will wait a minute before you call her
joey|ok
joey|why
phoebe|because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason
joey|i love that saying
joey|hello
other|joey it’s estelle
joey|i was just gonna call you
joey|that’s weird
other|it’s a little coincidental but believable
other|listen i’m sure you’re wondering why i didn’t get you an audition for that tv movie
joey|yeah actually i am
other|i guess i dropped the ball there
other|whoopsie
joey|that’s it
joey|you know it seems all you do lately is drop the ball
other|don’t take that tone with me
other|who you think you are
other|alan lemond the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic
joey|no no look
joey|all i’m saying is that you’re my agent ok
joey|and you’re not getting me into any auditions and i’m tired of it
other|what are you saying
joey|i’m saying that…
joey|this isn't working for me anymore ok
joey|estelle you’re fired
joey|goodbye
phoebe|man tough week for estelle
ross|hi
rachel|hi
ross|emma left her stuffed t rex at my house
ross|you know she can’t sleep without it
rachel|oh well she’s asleep now
rachel|stop forcing that thing on her
ross|ok
rachel|oh you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today
rachel|ralph lauren called and gave me my job back
ross|nooo
rachel|yee
rachel|i mean it was so weirdest thing
rachel|they fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back
rachel|i mean that place must have been falling apart without me
ross|so you’re not going to paris
rachel|no i’m still going
ross|wh… wh…what
rachel|when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back the offered me more money
rachel|isn’t that great
ross|yeeeah
monica|hi
monica|we’re buying the house next door and we were wondering if we could just take a look around
monica|lady oh sure
monica|i’m showing it to someone else right now but please look around
monica|thanks
chandler|it feels like we’re cheating on our house
chandler|and if we’re gonna cheat shouldn’t it be with like a hot younger house that does stuff that our house won’t do
monica|ours is so much better
monica|this living room is smaller the dining room looks like a cave
monica|what a hole
other|so
other|what do you think
monica|love it
other|well we already have one offer on it and i think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one
monica|they could be our neighbors what are they like
other|oh the woman upstairs is very nice
other|she and her husband have two kids he's on wall street and she…
other|oh my god
other|sure
phoebe|hey joey want come with me to… are you ok
joey|yeah i just… i just feel bad about firing estelle
joey|this is got to be killing her
phoebe|no that wouldn’t kill her
phoebe|ordinary embolism might
joey|i don’t know
joey|she’s got to be taking it hard i was like her only client
joey|except for this guy who eats paper
joey|and i’m guessing he eats more money than he makes
joey|look i know she’s not a great agent but she did stick with me for ten years
joey|i’m gonna call her and hire her again
phoebe|no no no
phoebe|don't call her
phoebe|you wait for her to call you
joey|why
phoebe|because patience is the road to understanding which
phoebe|is the key
phoebe|to a happy heart
joey|you blow me away
phoebe|all right so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you
joey|i promise
joey|and that means never having to give a reason
other|what a small world
other|chandler and yet i never run into beyonce
other|you two know each other
other|oh we go way back
other|before monica made an honest man out of him chandler used to be my little love muffin
other|so
other|are you guys thinking of getting this house too
other|ooh
other|are we gonna have a bidding war
other|i'd better warn you i'm a toughie
chandler|don't don't
monica|no actually we're buying the house next door
chandler|why
monica|i don't know why
other|ooh that decides it then
other|i was on the fence
other|but knowing that you two would be our neighbors
other|ah
other|now we have to get it
other|ellen we're going to talk numbers
chandler|this can not be happening
monica|okay the realtor said another couple made an offer
monica|maybe the janice's won't get it
monica|maybe the other couple will
chandler|the only way that that is going to happen is if the other couple are the hitlers
monica|okay okay all right
monica|what if we got both houses
monica|huh
monica|we can turn this house into a guest house
chandler|that is a great idea
chandler|and by the way i don't mean to sound distasteful but when did you start crapping money
monica|okay you come up with an idea
chandler|alright alright we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house
chandler|we can still get out
monica|but we love our house
chandler|will we love it so much with her next door
chandler|and she's gonna be louder out here too
chandler|just the crickets and oh my god 
monica|okay but if we don't get this house she's stil gonna show up wherever we go
monica|i mean at least if she's here it eliminates the element of suprise
monica|i mean never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body
chandler|well we have to do something
chandler|we can't have her living next door
chandler|oh that does it too
other|who is it
ross|it's me
ross|ron
ross|look i um i now rachel turned you down but i think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back
other|this may surprise you but re hiring fired employees is not my main job
ross|just hear me out
ross|how would you feel about offering her a raise
other|not good ron
ross|perhaps i can persuade you
ross|what if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica
other|wow that's pretty cool
ross|huh
ross|so
ross|we have a deal
other|okay you got it
ross|yes
ross|yes
other|this is gonna make me very popular
