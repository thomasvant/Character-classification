ross|hey you guys
phoebe|hey
ross|hey what are you doing
other|oh figuring out our wedding plans
chandler|that's funny we were doing the same thing
ross|yeah
phoebe|it's really crazy
phoebe|the hall the dress the food
phoebe|i i had no idea how expensive this stuff was
chandler|yeah it is really pricey
chandler|i mean i freaked when i first heard the numbers
phoebe|so what did you two do about it
chandler|it was pretty simple actually i came up with a couple of cost cutting solutions wrote out a list and monica told me to go to hell
ross|there's no way around it pheebs you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money
other|i heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry
ross|yeah and i'm responsible for just like half of that
phoebe|but really it does seem like this money could be put to better use
other|are you serious
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|now how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at city hall
other|i think it would make me wanna marry you even more
ross|i've got to say you guys that's an incredible gesture
chandler|maybe you do that next time you get married
ross|no no no
ross|the next time it's gonna be a hawaii at sunset
ross|but maybe the time after that
joey|hey
chandler|hey
joey|what's going on
chandler|our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment
monica|we
chandler|you know you don't want me to help
chandler|you can't have it both ways
joey|hey is this person who decides whether or not you
joey|get a baby
chandler|kind of
chandler|she's coming by to interview us and see where we live
monica|and it has to go perfectly because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state
joey|hey maybe i should stop by
joey|she could be a soap opera fan
joey|it's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity
chandler|little people
joey|celebrity
monica|ok so i think i'm just about done here unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere like
monica|p0rn or cigarettes
chandler|what
chandler|no
monica|chandler
chandler|i don't and i'm offended by the insinuation
monica|ok so there's not a magazine under the couch or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank or a filthy video in the vcr
chandler|i'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine but that tape is not mine
monica|it isn't mine
joey|well i guess we'll never know whose it is
other|may i help you
phoebe|yes
phoebe|we're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children
other|well any contribution large or small is always appreciated
phoebe|well i think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one
other|well this is very generous
phoebe|and we don't want any recognition
phoebe|this is completely anonymous
other|completely anonymous
other|from two kind strangers

rachel|all right well if you must know
rachel|i had a traumatic
rachel|swing incident
rachel|when i was little
ross|seriously
rachel|yes i was 4 years old and i was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain
rachel|and to get me out my mom had to had to cut a big chunk of my hair
rachel|and it was uneven for weeks
ross|and you made it through that
ross|i wonder who's gonna play you in the movie
rachel|ok fine
rachel|you can make fun of me
rachel|i do not want emma going there
rachel|and i was thinking claire danes
ross|look i'm sorry to hear about your tragedy ok
ross|but the swings are perfectly safe and besides emma loves them
ross|you know what you should come with us and you'll see
rachel|ross those things go like 40 miles an hour
rachel|ok
rachel|when you're
rachel|and there is that moment when you are at the top when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth
ross|space is filled with orbiting children
ross|look please just come on you know when you’ll see the look on emma’s face i swear you won’t regret it
rachel|all right
ross|good you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children do you
rachel|irrational huh
rachel|all right well i’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment
ross|oh yeah that’s the same i am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings
