phoebe|what
ross|umm
ross|that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named vicrum
phoebe|what
phoebe|why
ross|well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship
phoebe|if you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend i swear to lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers right now
ross|well phoebe i think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about vicrum his a kite designer and he used to date oprah
phoebe|i'm not going along with some lie you made ross no i'm just gonna be honest with him
ross|good yeah just be honest with him
phoebe|yeah i've nothing to be ashamed of ok so i haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month
phoebe|ok i haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave
phoebe|which he will and that's ok
phoebe|so i'll just be alone forever you know alright i'll be
phoebe|it'll be fine
phoebe|it'll be fine
phoebe|i'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians
phoebe|oh
ross|i'll get it
phoebe|ok
other|you know i'm trying to think of the last time i opened a door and you weren't there phoebe are you ok
