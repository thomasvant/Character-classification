phoebe|what
ross|umm
ross|that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named vicrum
phoebe|what
phoebe|why
ross|well he seemed to bum hard that you had never been in a serious relationship
phoebe|if you had not just had a baby with my best friend i swear to lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers right now
ross|well phoebe i think you will feel better when you know a little bit about vicrum his a kite designer and he used to date oprah
phoebe|not going along with some lie you made ross no just gonna be honest with him
ross|good yeah just be honest with him
phoebe|yeah nothing to be ashamed of ok so i have not been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month
phoebe|ok i have not had a real boyfriend you know if he cannot handle that he can leave
phoebe|which he will and that is ok
phoebe|so just be alone forever you know alright be
phoebe|it will be fine
