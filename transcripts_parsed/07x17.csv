phoebe|yeah but the swing kings
phoebe|y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts they just stop living
chandler|look all i know is when monica and i went to see them we had fun
chandler|and there’s another reason too
rachel|well what is the other reason
chandler|i don’t want to say
rachel|well you have to because maybe it’s stupid
chandler|well it’s just while monica and i were dancing to them it was…the first time i knew that…you were the woman i wanted to dance all my dances with
monica|oh crap
ross|so they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes

joey|was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian
other|do you two know each other
