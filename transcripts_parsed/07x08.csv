ross|what are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year
chandler|no we're playing this game i learned at work
chandler|you have to name all the states in six minutes
ross|what
ross|that's like insanely easy
chandler|now that's a lot harder than it sounds
chandler|you always forget at least one or in some cases
chandler|fourteen
monica|it's a stupid game and i wasn't playing against other people so technically i didn't lose
ross|what
ross|you forgot fourteen states
monica|nobody cares about the dakotas
chandler|oh okay time's up
rachel|all right i got 48
chandler|oh that's not bad pheebs
phoebe|oh i got tired of naming states
phoebe|so i decided to list the types of celery and i have one regular celery
chandler|okay so rachel's got 48 and phoebe has the lead in…vegetables joey
joey|say hello to the new champ of chandler's dumb states game
ross|wow how many have you got

rachel|but tag's not coming his girlfriend came into town so he's spending thanksgiving with her
monica|oh
monica|why didn't you tell me
monica|i made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin
rachel|well i was going to but then i figured you know
rachel|your food is so delicious and perfect you can never have too many of those pumpkin things
monica|now you think i wouldn't enjoy that because it is so fake but i still do
phoebe|regular celery
phoebe|oh i already have that
ross|done
ross|with time a to spare
chandler|oooh that may be a new world's record
ross|you know i hate to lecture you guys but it's kinda disgraceful that a group of well educated adults and joey can't name all the states
ross|did you ever see a map or one of those round colorful things called a globe
ross| hmm
chandler|uh magellan
chandler|you got 46 states
ross|what
ross|that's impossible
joey|46

monica|please watch him
monica|do not let joey eat any of the food
chandler|i am only one man
chandler|okay ross time is up
ross|no just give me another minute
chandler|look ross if you don't know them by now you will never know them okay
chandler|that is the beauty of this game
chandler|it makes you want to kill yourself
ross|this this is crazy
ross|i can do this
ross|all right uhh i bet i can get all 50 before dinner
chandler|okay but if you can't…no dinner
ross|you're on
joey|all right
joey|don't look at my list ross 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have
monica|hey did you guys know that your oven doesn't work
joey|but the drawer full of take out menus is okay right
monica|ross i'm gonna use yours okay
ross|pshhshhh
monica|chandler
monica|can you give me a hand
chandler|sure and joey do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment
joey|don't worry chandler it's not a globe of the united states
phoebe|hey you guys i'm gonna go out and take a walk
ross|phoebe why is your bag moving
phoebe|oh it's not
rachel|seriously it's moving
joey|what the hell is in there
phoebe|it's just my knitting that's all
phoebe|yes
phoebe|i knit this
phoebe|i'm very good
monica|ross’s apartment is nice
monica|how come we don't hang out here more often
chandler|i don't know
chandler|maybe it's because it smells a little weird
chandler|it's like old pumpkins or something
monica|that's my pie
chandler|which smells delicious
monica|uh oh
monica|uh oh
chandler|what
monica|we left joey alone with the food
monica|yep

monica|phoebe there's a dog sitting on my couch
chandler|tell her i'm allergic and i will sue
phoebe|no there's no dog here
monica|yes there is
monica|he's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to rachel and licking rachel's hand
phoebe|oh my god

monica|i'll be right there
phoebe|they're here already
phoebe|how are they doing this
rachel|hi tag
rachel|what are you doing here

chandler|what is it doing here
phoebe|well i'm watching it for some friends who went out of town
phoebe|wait
phoebe|hello my name is clunkers
phoebe|may i please stay with you nice people
monica|oooh i wish she could stay here but chandler is allergic
chandler|extremely allergic okay
chandler|if i'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes my throat will just close up
phoebe|that's odd 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
chandler|really
monica|chandler if that dog's been here that long and you haven't had a reaction maybe you're not allergic to this dog
chandler|well it still has to go right
other|why
chandler|okay it's um…
joey|don't do it
monica|don't do what
chandler|i have to
chandler|okay
chandler|it's time
chandler|okay i hate dogs
phoebe|are you crazy
ross|are you out of your mind
phoebe|why
joey|told ya
chandler|they are needy they are jumpy and you can't tell what they are thinking and that scares me a little bit
ross|right they are scary
ross|ahh she just ate a treat out of my hand
rachel|wait a minute
rachel|do you not like all dogs
rachel|i mean not even puppies
chandler|is there a puppy here
other|you don't like puppies
chandler|okay you are new
joey|look chandler i told you never tell anyone about this dog thing
joey|it's like ross not likin’ ice cream
phoebe|you don't like ice cream
ross|it's too cold
chandler|okay it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable
ross|it hurts my teeth
chandler|and i don't wanna say this i don't want you guys to hate me but uh i don't think i can be around that dog anymore
chandler|okay so either the dog goes or i go
chandler|oh my god
ross|how can i not get this
ross|i'm a college professor i got 1450 on my s
ross|a
ross|t
ross|s
monica|1250
ross|damn i forgot you were here
phoebe|all right
phoebe|we're gonna take clunkers to ross’s
phoebe|we'll be back in a minute
rachel|oh wait before you guys go can i just ask you a question
monica|yeah
rachel|when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move
phoebe|oh i'd say about a month
monica|really
monica|i'd say 3 to 4
joey|half hour
rachel|interesting
monica|when it's your assistant i would say never
joey|all right rach the big question is does he like you
joey|all right
joey|because if he doesn't like you this is all a moo point
rachel|huh
rachel|a moo point
joey|yeah it's like a cow's opinion
joey|it just doesn't matter
joey|it's moo
rachel|have i been living with him for too long or did that all just make sense
monica|please don't listen to joey okay
monica|would you look at him
monica|he he’s obviously depressed
monica|he's away from his family he's spending thanksgiving with strangers
monica|what he needs right now is for you to be his friend
rachel|you're right i'm sorry
rachel|thank you
rachel|okay that's what i'm gonna do
joey|fine
joey|take their advice
joey|no one ever listens to me

other|not bad
rachel|yeah
rachel|i'm sorry about your girlfriend
other|thanks
rachel|so were you guys together a long time

other|i kinda thought we'd end up together
other|i don't anymore
rachel|now that she broke up with you
other|yeah
rachel|yeah
rachel|hmmmm
other|it's weird
other|i always used to assume that i would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given
other|but lately it's like what if it's not
other|do you ever have that feeling
rachel|no…yeah all the time constantly
rachel|it's terrifying

other|wow
rachel|yeah i admit it
rachel|i have a crush on you and uh and and i know that's crazy because we work together and and nothing could ever happen and the last thing i want to do is is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable
