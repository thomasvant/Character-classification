ross|okay
joey|done
phoebe|okay great so do you want to do it together

chandler|dude
chandler|that is my girlfriend
joey|what so i gotta shut it down now
ross|all right i gotta take off
ross|picking up ben then we are off to the big audition
monica|it is gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be bens dad
ross|yeah
chandler|weirder than watching his two moms make out
joey|whoa whoa dad
joey|there is a dad in the commercial
ross|yeah the dad and ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it
joey|whoa hey maybe go down there with ya and see if i can get an audition to play the dad
joey|i mean who better to play bens father than his godfather
ross|you are not his godfather
joey|what
joey|are you kidding
ross|of course i am
ross|okay let us go godfather
joey|all right
joey|hey
joey|in they are gonna let me audition
ross|really
ross|that is great
joey|i know
joey|i know
joey|it turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play so i steered clear of her
other|hey that kid looks familiar
joey|oh yeah yeah
joey|he is done tons of commercials
joey|seen him in like sugar smacks playstation and that one for the phone company
joey|in fact he was so good in that one he actually convinced me to switch phone companies
joey|chandler was mad
ross|yeah well he is not gonna get this one
ross|ben is way cuter than that kid
ross|i mean look at him look at you
joey|that is great
joey|listen would not it be great though if i got to play bens dad
ross|joey you look nothing like ben
joey|i look more like him than you do
other|yknow i do not really know you well enough for you to do that
other|so it is down to these two nancy i know you like this one and i think i agree
other|rachel what do you think
rachel|well umm that one is pretty but uh i just i just love this fabric sorry
other|oh do not be sorry that is part of your job here to give your opinions and then i take credit for them kidding
other|she is kidding but do not ever disagree with her again
other|okay now kidding
rachel|oh what a fun office
other|i do not know which one but i do know i need a cigarette
other|so what do you say we take a break we go outside and we will figure this out when we come back
other|rachel
other|do you smoke
rachel|oh no my dads a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princesss right to smoke
rachel|and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me
monica|that does not seem fair
rachel|i know
rachel|it is like being punished for not having this disgusting poisoning habit
chandler|yeah it is the best
rachel|i mean what if this keeps happening
rachel|yknow they will they will be outside smoking making all the decisions and just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air yknow
rachel|and then when the day comes when kim wants to promote one of us who do you think she is gonna pick
rachel|me or smokey smokerson
monica|rachel you can go down there you do not have to smoke
