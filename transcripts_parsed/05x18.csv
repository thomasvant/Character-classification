joey|whoa
joey|this guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town
joey|ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition
joey|i mean way to go ben
joey|man
joey|i've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition
ross|i know it's crazy
ross|we were just pushing ben on the swings…

joey|what am i doing wrong
chandler|that
rachel|okay gotta go
rachel|wish me luck
joey|luck
chandler|hey rach now that you're working at ralph lauren can you bring me back some of those polo shirts
rachel|uh well y'know what
rachel|i don't think if i feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…
chandler|unwilling to steal from work interesting
monica|besides if anybody's gonna get free stuff it's gonna be me
rachel|okay guys way to wish me luck
phoebe|okay let's discuss rachel's birthday
phoebe|i say we throw a surprise party this weekend
joey|whoa whoa but her birthday isn't like for another month
phoebe|yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday then it's not a surprise
monica|i think it's a great idea
monica|yeah we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends
joey|ross
joey|we're having a surprise party for rachel
ross|okay
joey|done
phoebe|okay great so do you want to do it together
monica|i would love to do it together
joey|they're gonna do it together
chandler|dude
chandler|that's my girlfriend
joey|what so i gotta shut it down now
ross|all right i gotta take off
ross|i'm picking up ben then we're off to the big audition
monica|it's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be ben's dad
ross|yeah
chandler|weirder than watching his two moms make out
joey|whoa whoa dad
joey|there's a dad in the commercial
ross|yeah the dad and ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it
joey|whoa hey maybe i'll go down there with ya and see if i can get an audition to play the dad
joey|i mean who better to play ben's father than his godfather
ross|you're not his godfather
joey|what
joey|are you kidding
ross|of course i am
ross|okay let's go godfather
joey|all right
joey|hey
joey|i'm in they're gonna let me audition
ross|really
ross|that's great
joey|i know
joey|i know
joey|it turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play so i steered clear of her…
other|hey that kid looks familiar
joey|oh yeah yeah
joey|he's done tons of commercials
joey|i've seen him in like sugar smacks playstation and that one for the phone company
joey|in fact he was so good in that one he actually convinced me to switch phone companies
joey|chandler was mad…
ross|yeah well he's not gonna get this one
ross|ben is way cuter than that kid
ross|i mean look at him look at you 
joey|that's great
joey|listen wouldn't it be great though if i got to play ben's dad
ross|joey you look nothing like ben
joey|i look more like him than you do
other|y'know i don't really know you well enough for you to do that
other|so it's down to these two nancy i know you like this one and i think i agree
other|rachel what do you think
rachel|well umm that one is pretty but uh i just i just love this fabric sorry
other|oh don't be sorry that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then i take credit for them i'm kidding
other|she is kidding but don't ever disagree with her again
other|okay now i'm kidding
rachel|oh what a fun office
other|i don't know which one but i do know i need a cigarette
other|so what do you say we take a break we go outside and we'll figure this out when we come back
other|rachel
other|do you smoke
rachel|oh no my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories……about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke
rachel|…and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me
monica|that doesn't seem fair
rachel|i know
rachel|it's like i'm being punished for not having this disgusting poisoning habit
chandler|yeah it is the best
rachel|i mean what if this keeps happening
rachel|y'know they'll they'll be outside smoking making all the decisions and i'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air y'know
rachel|and then when the day comes when kim wants to promote one of us who do you think she's gonna pick
rachel|me or smokey smokerson
monica|rachel you can go down there you don't have to smoke
monica|just say you wanna get some fresh air
rachel|yeah i can do that
chandler|yeah or you can do the easy thing and smoke
