ross|now do you have any idea what you just said
joey|no no my mouth says the words my brain is thinking monster trucks
ross|ok now remember when you get to the museum monet is not spelt m o n a y
ross|i just
ross|i wrote that out phonetically for you
joey|phonetically
ross|yeah yeah that means
ross|you know
ross|we just
ross|we don't have time for this
joey|ok
ross|ok but you know what
ross|i gotta say i'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly

joey|i can memorize anything
joey|last week on days i had to say frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy 
ross|wow
ross|what does that mean
joey|no idea
joey|but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i guess it means you're gonna get eaten by a bear 
ross|ok
ross|so let's move on to the renaissance
joey|ok caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure
joey|touch it it's really bumpy

other|you and monica are meant to have children
other|i am sure it's gonna be just fine
chandler|oh oh yeah ok thanks

chandler|i guess i was just so worried about having to
chandler|come here and do
chandler|'that'
other|what you can do it in the parking lot of a taco bell but you can't do it at a doctor's office
chandler|it was a wendy's
chandler| 
phoebe| ipan stripan glupi glabi
phoebe| and that is the swedish national anthem
phoebe|thank you for asking
rachel|wow ikea
rachel|what a rich culture
rachel|uhm you know what
rachel|i have a friend who is a masseuse
phoebe|oh ja
phoebe|ja
rachel|yah
rachel|she's
rachel|uhm
rachel|not very good though
phoebe|uhu uhu
phoebe|and why do you think that is
rachel|i don't know
rachel|maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar
phoebe|or
phoebe|maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass
rachel|phoebe
phoebe|you know it's me
rachel|for like a half an hour
rachel|man you can lie about sweden
phoebe|how can you come here
rachel|how could you not tell me you worked here
phoebe|i don't have to tell you everything
rachel|yes you do if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage
phoebe|tips not included
rachel|oh
rachel|phoebe why did you lie to me about working here
phoebe|because i was ashamed ok
phoebe|i sold out for the cash
phoebe|and then they give me benefits like medical and dental and a 401k
phoebe|but you know
phoebe|you pay a price
phoebe|now i'm this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh
phoebe|paying taxes
rachel|phoebe honey if you hate it so much you should walk out there right now and quit
rachel|be true to what you believe in
rachel|honey you have principles and i so admire that
rachel|i don't have any
phoebe|you know what
phoebe|you are right
phoebe|i am gonna quit
phoebe|it's time i took my life back
rachel|good for you pheebs

ross|die die die
ross|respectfully professor r
ross|geller
ross|hey
other|hi
ross|hey how was the met
other|the museum was amazing
ross|yeah
ross|joey really knows his art huh
other|not so much no
other|he had clearly memorized all the stuff to say and some of it didn't even make any sense
ross|what do you mean
other|well for one he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around
ross|wait a minute
ross|when you guys walked into the met did you go to the right
other|no we went to the left
ross|oh joey joey
ross|but still i mean it seems like you guys are having a great time together
other|yeah it's fun
ross|what
other|actually you know joey is your friend and you don't really know me that well it would be weird
ross|what i mean a little but no what go on
other|well
other|i'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now maybe i should be with someone
other|i have more in common with
other|you know what i mean
ross|yeah
ross|but you know what
ross|i think you should give joey a chance
ross|i mean he's a great guy and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know you can always talk about that with someone else
other|yeah i guess that's true
ross|and if you think about it i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you
ross|you know that's the kind of guy joey is
other|he is very sweet
other|plus he's hot
ross|that was going to be my next argument
joey|hey
ross|hey
other|hey
joey|you're ready
other|yeah let's go
other|thanks ross
joey|hey ross
joey|that art stuff worked you hooked me up
ross|glad i could help man

monica| but so what is it
monica|is there a problem uh
monica|is there a problem with me or with you
chandler|actually it's both of us
monica|what
chandler|apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment
monica|oh
monica|what does that mean
chandler|it means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do
chandler|it means
monica|chandler
chandler|it means that we can keep trying but there's a good chance this may never happen for us
