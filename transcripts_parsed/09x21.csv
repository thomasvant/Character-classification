joey|last week on days i had to say frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy
ross|wow
ross|what does that mean

chandler|i guess i was just so worried about having to
chandler|come here and do
chandler|that
other|what you can do it in the parking lot of a taco bell but you cannot do it at a doctors office
chandler|it was a wendys
phoebe|ipan stripan glupi glabi

rachel|yah
rachel|she is
rachel|uhm
rachel|not very good though
phoebe|uhu uhu
phoebe|and why do you think that is
rachel|i do not know
rachel|maybe it is because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar
phoebe|or
phoebe|maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you are such a high maintenance tight ass
rachel|phoebe
phoebe|you know it is me
rachel|for like a half an hour
rachel|man you can lie about sweden
phoebe|how can you come here
rachel|how could you not tell me you worked here
phoebe|i do not have to tell you everything
rachel|yes you do if you are going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage
phoebe|tips not included
rachel|oh
rachel|phoebe why did you lie to me about working here
phoebe|because i was ashamed ok
phoebe|i sold out for the cash
phoebe|and then they give me benefits like medical and dental and a 401k
phoebe|but you know
phoebe|you pay a price
phoebe|now this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh
phoebe|paying taxes
rachel|phoebe honey if you hate it so much you should walk out there right now and quit
rachel|be true to what you believe in
rachel|honey you have principles and i so admire that

ross|respectfully professor r
ross|geller
ross|hey
other|hi
ross|hey how was the met
other|the museum was amazing
ross|yeah
ross|joey really knows his art huh
other|not so much no
other|he had clearly memorized all the stuff to say and some of it did not even make any sense
ross|what do you mean
other|well for one he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around
ross|wait a minute
ross|when you guys walked into the met did you go to the right
other|no we went to the left
ross|oh joey joey
ross|but still i mean it seems like you guys are having a great time together
other|yeah it is fun
ross|what
other|actually you know joey is your friend and you do not really know me that well it would be weird
ross|what i mean a little but no what go on
other|well
other|just thinking that maybe he is not the right guy to be with right now maybe i should be with someone
other|i have more in common with
other|you know what i mean
ross|yeah
ross|but you know what
ross|i think you should give joey a chance
ross|i mean he is a great guy and sure he does not know that much about art but you know you can always talk about that with someone else
other|yeah i guess that is true
ross|and if you think about it i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you
ross|you know that is the kind of guy joey is
other|he is very sweet
other|plus he is hot
ross|that was going to be my next argument
joey|hey
ross|hey
other|hey

chandler|apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment
monica|oh
