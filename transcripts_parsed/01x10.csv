ross|oh that had be great
ross|okay but if you do make sure it seems like you are there to see him okay and you are not like doing it as a favour to me

other|but you cannot actually test this theory because todays particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions
phoebe|okay alright i have a question then
