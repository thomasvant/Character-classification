phoebe|yeah noisy boys
phoebe|is it something that you would like to share with the entire group
other|no
other|no that's that's okay
phoebe|well c'mon if it's important enough to discuss while i'm playing then i assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear
chandler|that guy's going home with a note
other|noth i was i was just saying to my 
phoebe|could you speak up please
other|sorry i wa i was just saying to my friend that i thought you were the most beautiful woman that i'd ever seen in my in my life
other|and then he said that you said you thought
other|daryl hannah
other|daryl hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and i said yeah i liked her in splash a lot but not so much in in wall street i thought she had kind of a
other|hard quality
other| hard quality
other|and uh while daryl hannah is beautiful in a conventional way you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace
other|then uh that that that's when you started yelling
phoebe|okay we're gonna take a short break
joey|hey that guy's going home with more than a note
ross|come here marcel
ross|sit here
rachel|pheebs i can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet
rachel|i mean god by my sixth date with paolo i mean he had already named both my breasts
rachel|ooh

phoebe|except except he he's smarter and gentler and sweeter
phoebe|i just i just wanna be with him all the time
phoebe|day and night and night and day
phoebe|and special occasions
chandler|wait a minute wait a minute i see where this is going you're gonna ask him to new year's aren't you
chandler|you're gonna break the pact
chandler|she's gonna break the pact
phoebe|no no no no no no
phoebe|yeah could i just
chandler|yeah 'cause i already asked janice
monica|what
ross|c'mon this was a pact
ross|this was your pact
chandler|i snapped okay
chandler|i couldn't handle the pressure and i snapped
monica|yeah but janice
monica|that that was like the worst breakup in history
chandler|i'm not saying it was a good idea i'm saying i snapped
joey|hi
joey|hi sorry i'm late
chandler|too many jokes
chandler|must mock joey
joey|nice shoes huh
chandler|aah y'killing me
monica|ross
monica|he's playing with my spatulas again
ross|okay look he's not gonna hurt them right
monica|do you always have to bring him here
ross|i didn't wanna leave him alone
ross|alright
ross|we we had our first fight this morning
ross|i think it has to do with my working late
ross|i said some things that i didn't mean and he he threw some faeces
chandler|y'know if you're gonna work late i could look in on him for you
ross|oh that'd be great
ross|okay but if you do make sure it seems like you're there to see him okay and you're not like doing it as a favour to me
chandler|okay but if he asks i'm not going to lie
other|but you can't actually test this theory because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions
phoebe|okay alright i have a question then
other|yuh
phoebe|um were you planning on kissing me ever
other|uh that's definitely a uh valid question
other|and uh the answer would be yes
other|yes i was
other|but see i wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment because well 'cause it's you
phoebe|sure
other|right
other|but see the longer i waited the more phenomenal the kiss had to be and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where i just like
other|sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it
other|and uh i'm not really a uh sweeping sorta fella
phoebe|oh david i i think you are a sweeping sorta fella
phoebe|i mean you're a sweeper
phoebe|trapped inside a physicist's body
other|rrrreally
phoebe|oh yeah oh i'm sure of it
phoebe|you should just do it just sweep and throw me
other|now
other|now
phoebe|oh yeah right now
other|okay okay okay
other|y'know what this was just really expensive
other|and i'll take this was a gift
phoebe|okay now you're just kinda tidying
other|okay what the hell what the hell
other|you want me to actually throw you or you you wanna just hop
