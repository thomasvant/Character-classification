other|this is an hour long special episode
other|which means that the first part of this episode is episode 615
other|the second part of this episode is episode 616
other|since episodes 615 and 616 are combined into one file that’s why there is no episode 616 in the season 6 table of contents and the numbers jump from episode 615 to 617
rachel|hey you guys
rachel|guess what
rachel|barry and mindy are getting a divorce
monica|oh my god
phoebe|wow
joey|what is the matter with you
phoebe|no
phoebe|barry and mindy
joey|oh sorry i hear divorce i immediately go to ross
joey|who who’s barry and mindy
rachel|barry was the guy that i was almost married and mindy was my best friend
joey|ohh oh wasn’t he cheating on you with her
rachel|yeah but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me
monica|why did they get divorced
rachel|well apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else
rachel|isn’t that sad
rachel|god could you imagine if i actually married him
rachel|i mean how different would my life be
ross|i know what you mean i’ve always wondered how different my life would be if if i’d never gotten divorced
phoebe|which time
ross|the first time
ross|no seriously imagine if carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian
joey|i can’t
joey|i keep seeing it the good way
ross|i’d bet i’d still be doing my kara tay
ross|towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know not doing anything else physical
chandler|maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara tay
monica|and what if i was still fat
monica|well you wouldn’t be dating me that’s for sure
chandler|sure i would
chandler|what you guys really think that i’m that shallow
ross|no i just think monica was that fat
joey|hey imagine if i never got fired off days of our lives
joey|oh hey there’s carol again
chandler|what if i had had the guts to quit my job
chandler|i’d probably be writing for the new yorker getting paid to be funny
chandler|but my job’s fun too
chandler|i mean tomorrow i i don’t have to wear a tie
phoebe|what if i had taken that job at merrill lynch
ross|what
rachel|merrill lynch
phoebe|yeah i had a massage client who worked there and and he said i had a knack for stocks
rachel|well why didn’t you take the job
phoebe|because at that time you see i thought everything that rhymed was true
phoebe|so i thought y’know that if i’d work with stocks i’d have to live in a box and only eat lox and have a pet fox
ross|hey do you guys think that if all those things happened we’d still hang out
other|this is where the opening credits are but they’re not the usual opening credits
other|oh no
other|these credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened
other|it starts out with all of them at the fountain sitting on the couch as fat monica runs up and sits on the arm of the couch tilting the whole thing towards her
other|it then goes on to show rachel’s still a shop aholic and with barry
other|fat monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating a donut
other|phoebe as the wall street shark smoking while on two cell phones
other|then they’re dancing in the fountain
other|joey entering as dr
other|drake remoray and meeting a groupie
other|chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling asleep while typing
other|ross doing some kara tay and trying to get carol into bed
other|and finally some more dancing in the fountain them all flexing and the turning out the lamp and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season
other|just remember one thing this is an alternate universe
other|everything from every other episode doesn’t apply for instance ross and rachel have no history
other|and in fact have not seen each other in years in this world
ross|oh my god
ross|rachel green
