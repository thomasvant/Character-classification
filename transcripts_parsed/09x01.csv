ross|she’s so exhausted
phoebe|and so engaged
ross|what
ross|oh my god
ross|she she thinks we’re engaged
ross|why
ross|why
ross|why would she think we’re engaged
phoebe|perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring
phoebe|y’know ross doctors are supposed to be smart
ross|i didn’t give her that ring
phoebe|really
ross|no
phoebe|so whose ring is it
ross|it’s mine
phoebe|is it an engagement ring
ross|yes
phoebe|but you didn’t give it to her
ross|no
phoebe|but you were going to propose
ross|no
phoebe|huh i might be losing interest in this
ross|look
ross|look my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to rachel but all i wanted to do is if she maybe kinda wanted ah start things up again
phoebe|oh what beautiful lukewarm sentiment
ross|look i didn’t want to rush into anything
ross|and it seemed like she didn’t want to either
ross|but i don’t i don’t understand how any of this happened
ross|what
ross|did she find the ring in my jacket assume that i was going to propose throw it on and and just start telling people
phoebe|no
phoebe|no she said you actually proposed to her
ross|well i didn’t
ross|i didn’t propose
ross|unless uh did i
ross|i haven’t slept in forty hours and it does sound like something i would do
chandler|look we can’t stay in here forever
monica|oh i still can’t believe my dad saw us having s x
monica|he didn’t make it to one of piano recitals but this he sees
chandler|this is okay
chandler|we’re all adults here there’s nothing to be ashamed of
chandler|now let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door
monica|hi dad
monica|i can still call you that right
other|of course
other|i’ll always be your dad
chandler|i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there that wasn’t for fun
monica|it wasn’t fun
chandler|why
chandler|why why would you wh why look i just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want
other|oh i don’t think that
other|before today i never thought of you two having s x at all
other|it was a simpler time
monica|the truth is dad we’re we’re trying
other|what
monica|yeah we’re trying to get pregnant
other|oh my god
other|this is so exciting
other|well get back in there
other|i’ll guard the door
monica|well that’s okay dad we we can wait until later
other|whoa whoa whoa
other|i don’t think so
other|aren’t you ovulating
monica|daddy
other|well you gotta get at it princess
other|when your mother and i were trying to conceive you whenever she was ovulating bam we did it
other|that’s how i got my bad hip
chandler|that’s funny this conversation’s how i got the bullet hole in my head
other|this one time i had my knee up on the sink and your mother she was
monica|daddy
monica|i don’t think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had s x
other|you’re right you’re right
other|this is about your positions
other|now what i saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child although it might feel good
monica|i don’t feel good right now
other|but pleasure is important and it helps if the woman has an orgasm
other|you up to the task sailor
chandler|seriously sir my brains
chandler|all over the wall
