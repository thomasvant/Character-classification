chandler|let me ask you why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays
chandler|i remember when people used to use big lights
rachel|that’s a good story grandpa
ross|hey
ross|wow monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree
ross|did someone get her drunk again or
monica|having a perfectly decorated tree is not what christmas is about
monica|it’s about being with the people that you love
phoebe|that is nice and we’re done
phoebe|tada
chandler|i dunno what it is it just doesn’t quite feel like christmas to me
monica|oh here
chandler|see now it feels like christmas
ross|and that’s the story of the dreidle
ross|now some people trace the christmas tree back to the egyptians who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year symbolising life’s triumph over death
ross|and that was like 4000 years ago
rachel|so pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story
joey|hey you guys
chandler|hey joe what’s up
joey|i had to get out of the apartment
joey|janine is like stretching all over the place
joey|y’know everywhere i look she’s like
chandler|i can see why that’s hard to resist
joey|i like her so much
monica|aw i’m sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way
joey|i know
joey|and she’s so sweet
joey|i just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair
chandler|you are aware that she’s not a monkey right
ross|i am so over janine
ross|i mean yeah at first i thought she was hot but now she’s like old news
other|hey guys
ross|hi janine
