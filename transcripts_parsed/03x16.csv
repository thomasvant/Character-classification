chandler|oh my god
chandler|oh my god
joey|yeah
joey|we figured when we couldn’t find you you’d gone home to make up with rachel
joey|which is probably what you shoulda done
joey|huh
ross|you think
ross|god i ah i’m in hell
ross|i mean what what am i gonna do
ross|rachel’s all like ‘i love you and and let’s work on this
ross|’ and all i can think about is ‘what is she gonna do
ross|what is she gonna say
ross|’ when i tell her what i did
chandler|well before we answer that i think we should address the more important question
chandler|how dumb are you
ross|what
ross|look we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here right
ross|how am i supposed to do that here without being totally honest with each other
joey|look ross look i’m on board about this totally honesty thing i am just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble
chandler|he’s right
chandler|nobody’s gonna benefit and you’re just gonna hurt her
joey|yeah and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild
ross|yeah but don’t you think
chandler|all right look if you absolutely have to tell her at least wait until the timing’s right
chandler|and that’s what deathbeds are for
ross|yeah okay
joey|all right okay now we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way
joey|did you think about the trail
ross|what trail
joey|the trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it
joey|you always have to think about the trail
ross|oh i i don’t think there’s any trail
chandler|okay okay okay ah chloe works with that guy issac
chandler|issac’s sister is jasmine
chandler|and jasmine works at that message place with phoebe
chandler|and phoebe’s friends with rachel
chandler|and that’s the trail i did it
phoebe|after applying the waxine and linen strips to leg number one
monica|did that
phoebe|grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion
monica|okay
monica|ow
monica|ow oh oh
phoebe|was it not pain free
monica|no
monica|it was painful
monica|oh my god they should call it pain zine now with a little wax
phoebe|huh well the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad
monica|that’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid
monica|but hey yknow if you don’t believe me please by my guest
phoebe|ow ow ow ow
phoebe|oh my god
monica|now are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips
ross|chloe
