ross|just just so you know i was a freshman and she was a senior
ross|so it wasn’t as bad as as…
other|ross look i know i’ve been giving you a lot of jabs and it’s partly because i’m very protective of lizzie and partly because well they just keep coming to me
other|but i have to admit that after all the wonderful things that lizzie has told me and the many many many stories that rachel has told me that well you’re not all bad
ross|not all bad
other|and anyhow i’m sorry i was so harsh before but you have to understand that i still look at lizzie like she’s a twelve year old girl
ross|yeah
ross|you know what
ross|i know what you mean i do that too
other|i beg your pardon
ross|no
ross|no
ross|not i don’t mean i i see her as a twelve year old girl
