monica|there's nothing to tell
monica|he's just some guy i work with
joey|c'mon, you're going out with the guy
joey|there's gotta be something wrong with him
chandler|so does he have a hump
chandler|a hump and a hairpiece
phoebe|wait, does he eat chalk
phoebe|just, 'cause, i don't want her to go through what i went through with carl- oh
monica|okay, everybody relax
monica|this is not even a date
monica|it's just two people going out to dinner and- not having s*x
chandler|sounds like a date to me
chandler|alright, so i'm back in high school, i'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and i realise i am totally naked
|oh, yeah
|had that dream
chandler|then i look down, and i realise there's a phone
chandler|there
joey|instead of
chandler|that's right
joey|never had that dream
phoebe|no
chandler|all of a sudden, the phone starts to ring
chandler|and it turns out it's my mother, which is very weird, because- she never calls me
ross|hi
joey|this guy says hello, i wanna kill myself
monica|are you okay, sweetie
ross|i just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck
chandler|cookie
monica|carol moved her stuff out today
monica|let me get you some coffee
phoebe|ooh
phoebe|oh
ross|no, no don't
ross|stop cleansing my aura
ross|no, just leave my aura alone, okay
ross|i'll be fine, alright
ross|really, everyone
ross|i hope she'll be very happy
monica|no you don't
ross|no i don't, to hell with her, she left me
joey|and you never knew she was a lesbian
ross|no
ross|okay
ross|why does everyone keep fixating on that
ross|she didn't know, how should i know
chandler|sometimes i wish i was a lesbian
chandler|did i say that out loud
joey|alright ross, look
joey|you're feeling a lot of pain right now
joey|you're angry
joey|you're hurting
joey|can i tell you what the answer is
joey|strip joint
joey|c'mon, you're single
joey|have some hormones
ross|i don't want to be single, okay
ross|i just
ross|i just- i just wanna be married again
chandler|and i just want a million dollars
monica|rachel
rachel|oh god monica hi
rachel|i just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are
other|can i get you some coffee
monica|de-caff
monica|okay, everybody, this is rachel, another lincoln high survivor
monica|this is everybody, this is chandler, and phoebe, and joey, and- you remember my brother ross
rachel|hi, sure
ross|hi
monica|so you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids
rachel|oh god
rachel|well, it started about a half hour before the wedding
rachel|i was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and i was looking at this gravy boat
rachel|this really gorgeous lamauge gravy boat
rachel|when all of a sudden- sweet 'n' lo
rachel|- i realised that i was more turned on by this gravy boat than by barry
rachel|and then i got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much barry looks like mr
rachel|potato head
rachel|y'know, i mean, he always looked familiar, but
rachel|anyway, i just had to get out of there, and i started wondering 'why am i doing this, and who am i doing this for
rachel|'
rachel|so anyway i just didn't know where to go, and i know that you and i have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person i knew who lived here in the city
monica|who wasn't invited to the wedding
rachel|ooh, i was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue
monica|now i'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it
rachel|daddy, i just
rachel|i can't marry him
rachel|i'm sorry
rachel|i just don't love him
rachel|well, it matters to me
chandler|ooh, she should not be wearing those pants
joey|i say push her down the stairs
phoebe|push her down the stairs
phoebe|push her down the stairs
phoebe|push her down the stairs
ross|push her down the stairs
ross|push her down the stairs
ross|push her down the stairs
chandler|push her down the stairs
chandler|push her down the stairs
chandler|push her down the stairs
joey|push her down the stairs
joey|push her down the stairs
joey|push her down the stairs
rachel|c'mon daddy, listen to me
rachel|all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'you're a shoe
rachel|you're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe
rachel|'
rachel|and today i just stopped and i said, 'what if i don't wanna be a shoe
rachel|what if i wanna be a- a purse, y'know
rachel|or a- or a hat
rachel|no, i'm not saying i want you to buy me a hat, i'm saying i am a ha- it's a metaphor, daddy
ross|you can see where he'd have trouble
rachel|look daddy, it's my life
rachel|well maybe i'll just stay here with monica
monica|well, i guess we've established who's staying here with monica
rachel|well, maybe that's my decision
rachel|well, maybe i don't need your money
rachel|wait
rachel|wait, i said maybe
monica|just breathe, breathe
monica|that's it
monica|just try to think of nice calm things
phoebe|raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens,
phoebe|bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens
phoebe|la la la la
rachel|i'm all better now
phoebe|i helped
monica|okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know
monica|independence
monica|taking control of your life
joey|and hey, you need anything, you can always come to joey
joey|me and chandler live across the hall
joey|and he's away a lot
monica|joey, stop hitting on her
monica|it's her wedding day

chandler|please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound
other|it's, uh, it's paul
monica|buzz him in
joey|who's paul
ross|paul the wine guy, paul
monica|maybe
joey|wait
joey|your 'not a real date' tonight is with paul the wine guy

phoebe|ooh, i just pulled out four eyelashes
phoebe|that can't be good
ross|so rachel, what're you, uh
ross|what're you up to tonight
rachel|well, i was kinda supposed to be headed for aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing
ross|right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, god
ross|no, no, although, aruba, this time of year
ross|talk about your-  -big lizards
ross|anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, joey and chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture
chandler|yes, and we're very excited about it
rachel|well actually thanks, but i think i'm just gonna hang out here tonight
ross|okay, sure
joey|hey pheebs, you wanna help
phoebe|oh, i wish i could, but i don't want to
ross|i'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little whim guys
ross|i have no brackety thing, i see no whim guys whatsoever and- i cannot feel my legs
joey|what's this
chandler|i have no idea
joey|done with the bookcase
chandler|all finished
ross|this was carol's favourite beer
ross|she always drank it out of the can, i should have known
joey|ross, let me ask you a question
joey|she got the furniture, the stereo, the good tv- what did you get
ross|you guys
chandler|oh, man
joey|you got screwed
monica|oh my god
other|i know, i know, i'm such an idiot
other|i guess i should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week
other|i mean, how clean can teeth get
monica|my brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess
monica|how did you get through it
other|well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
monica|-leg
other|that's one way
other|me, i- i went for the watch
monica|you actually broke her watch
rachel|barry, i'm sorry
rachel|i am so sorry
rachel|i know you probably think that this is all about what i said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't
rachel|it isn't, it's about me, and i ju-  hi, machine cut me off again
rachel|anyway
ross|you know what the scariest part is
ross|what if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know
ross|i mean what if you get one woman- and that's it
ross|unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her
joey|what are you talking about
joey|'one woman'
joey|that's like saying there's only one flavour of ice cream for you
joey|lemme tell you something, ross
joey|there's lots of flavours out there
joey|there's rocky road, and cookie dough, and bing
joey|cherry vanilla
joey|you could get 'em with jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream
joey|this is the best thing that ever happened to you
joey|you got married, you were, like, what, eight
joey|welcome back to the world
joey|grab a spoon
ross|i honestly don't know if i'm hungry or horny
chandler|stay out of my freezer
other|ever since she walked out on me, i, uh
monica|what
monica|what, you wanna spell it out with noodles
other|no, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation
monica|oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date
other|isn't there
monica|yeah
monica|yeah, i think there is
monica|-what were you gonna say
other|well, ever-ev-
other|ever since she left me, um, i haven't been able to, uh, perform
other|sexually
monica|oh god, oh god, i am sorry
monica|i am so sorry
other|it's okay
monica|being spit on is probably not what you need right now
monica|um
monica|how long
other|two years
monica|wow
monica|i'm glad you smashed her watch
other|so you still think you, um
other|might want that fifth date
monica|yeah
monica|yeah, i do
other|'i, joanie, take you, charles, to be my lawful husband
other|' 'do you take
other|'
rachel|oh
rachel|see
rachel|but joanie loved chachi
rachel|that's the difference
ross|grab a spoon
ross|do you know how long it's been since i've grabbed a spoon
ross|do the words 'billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you
ross|y'know, here's the thing
ross|even if i could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,
ross|who am i gonna ask
rachel|isn't this amazing
rachel|i mean, i have never made coffee before in my entire life

joey|yeah, i'm an actor

other|y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years
joey|of course it was a line
monica|why
monica|why
monica|why, why would anybody do something like that
ross|i assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'
monica|is it me
monica|is it like i have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear
phoebe|all right, c'mere, gimme your feet
monica|i just thought he was nice, y'know
joey|i can't believe you didn't know it was a line
rachel|guess what
ross|you got a job
rachel|are you kidding
rachel|i'm trained for nothing
rachel|i was laughed out of twelve interviews today
chandler|and yet you're surprisingly upbeat
rachel|you would be too if you found john and david boots on sale, fifty percent off
chandler|oh, how well you know me
rachel|they're my new 'i don't need a job, i don't need my parents, i've got great boots' boots
monica|how'd you pay for them
rachel|uh, credit card
monica|and who pays for that
rachel|um
rachel|my
rachel|father
monica|c'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life
rachel|i know that
rachel|that's why i was getting married
phoebe|give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time
rachel|thank you
phoebe|you're welcome
phoebe|i remember when i first came to this city
phoebe|i was fourteen
phoebe|my mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and i got here, and i didn't know anybody
phoebe|and i ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windows outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then i found aromatherapy
phoebe|so believe me, i know exactly how you feel
ross|the word you're looking for is 'anyway'
monica|you ready
rachel|i don't think so
ross|c'mon, cut
ross|cut, cut, cut,
|cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut
monica|welcome to the real world

rachel|i knew
ross|you did
ross|oh
ross|i always figured you just thought i was monica's geeky older brother
rachel|i did
ross|oh
ross|listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if i asked you out
ross|sometime
ross|maybe
rachel|yeah, maybe
ross|okay
