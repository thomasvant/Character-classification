chandler|so you risked your life for a sandwich
joey|i know it sounds crazy but chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world

rachel|hey
rachel|yknow what
rachel|you are in our apartment all the time
rachel|okay
rachel|this is this is just a drop in the bucket mister
ross|yknow it it does not matter
ross|the important thing is that you are here
ross|you are my friend and you are here
ross|oh
rachel|okay just a little scared
rachel|what is going on ross
ross|the most amazing thing happened tonight
ross|i thought my number was up
ross|i had an actual near death experience
rachel|what
rachel|what
rachel|what happened
ross|okay okay we were on the ride along with gary right
rachel|yeah
ross|and somebody took a shot at me
rachel|really
ross|no a car backfired but i thought somebody was taking a shot at me
ross|and rach i i survived
ross|and i was filled with this this great respect for life
ross|yknow
ross|i i want to experience every moment
ross|i want to seize every opportunity
ross|i i am seeing everything so so clearly now
rachel|because a car backfired
ross|okay why are you here
rachel|well i i i do not know how this fits into your whole seizing thing but um emily called you today
ross|you talked to her
rachel|no she left a message
rachel|but it it kinda got erased
rachel|there is just something wrong with your machine
ross|well okay what what did she say
rachel|well uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh she wants you to call her
ross|wow
rachel|now that that was a good thing that i told you right
ross|huh
ross|yeah
ross|yes of course
rachel|okay
rachel|thank you
rachel|thank you
rachel|because sorry all right
rachel|because yknow what
rachel|she did not want me not important
rachel|the point is i was right
rachel|you are decision
rachel|okay
rachel|i was right
rachel|you are decision
ross|right
ross|i guess i guess i should call emily
rachel|okay no that is not the right decision
rachel|that is not that is not right no ross ross come on
rachel|i mean that woman made you miserable
rachel|okay ross do you really want to get back into that
ross|okay look yesterday i would have even considered calling her back but my ex wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience
ross|i mean that that has got to mean something
rachel|ugh ross
rachel|that was not a near death experience
rachel|that was barely an experience
ross|you were not there
ross|okay maybe this is something that i supposed to seize
ross|yknow
rachel|okay yknow what
rachel|maybe this is not about seizing stuff
rachel|maybe this is about escaping stuff
ross|huh
rachel|i mean look look today you escaped death yknow
rachel|and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily
ross|that does make sense
ross|because i do wanna seize some opportunity but i i really do not wanna see or talk to her
rachel|well there you go
ross|yeah
ross|maybe today is just close call day
rachel|close call day
ross|hey thanks rach
rachel|ohh honey no problem
rachel|okay
ross|oh wait wait wait
ross|the message is blinking
ross|maybe you did not erase it
rachel|oh

rachel|no
ross|hey umm was was monica here
rachel|yeah
ross|yeah i want my money back
rachel|yeah uh you you probably need that for stamps right
ross|hey pheebs has gary ever been shot at for real
phoebe|yes
phoebe|once
phoebe|yeah a little
phoebe|he kinda did it to himself
phoebe|it is not really a good story
ross|i wonder how i would react under fire yknow
ross|and not backfire but but heavy fire like i was in a war or something
monica|man i would be great in a war
monica|i mean i really i think i would make a fantastic military leader
monica|i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys
chandler|before or after you were shot by your own troops
ross|i know where joey would be
ross|he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us
chandler|yes if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches
joey|yeah hero sandwiches
phoebe|well you all know that a pacifist so not interested in war in any way
phoebe|but yknow what
phoebe|when the revolution comes i will have to destroy you all
phoebe|not you joey
