phoebe|my god joey
chandler|it was a car backfire
ross|yeah but but he didn't know that
joey|yeah i didn't know that
ross|and it could've just as easily have been a bullet
other|hey joe you ever think about joining the force
other|we could use a guy like you
chandler|who jumps at loud noises
ross|wow
ross|i could've died tonight
chandler|yeah
chandler|if the car that backfired had run over you
chandler|y'know what i think i'll go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life

chandler|oh my god
other|so you wanna get some dinner
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|sure
phoebe|yep

joey|you want ross out of the picture
chandler|what picture
joey|i don't know but i don't like what i'm hearing
chandler|look i'm very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire but y'know it could've been a bullet and you y'know you didn't try to save me
joey|ohh you're upset because you think i chose ross over you
joey|no
joey|i…knew…you could take care of yourself
joey|y'know i mean ross he need help
joey|he's not street like us
chandler|when it comes down to it you would risk your life for ross before you would for me
chandler|that's the bottom line
joey|well no not exactly
joey|all right look i i wasn't trying to save ross
joey|okay
joey|my sandwich was next to ross
joey|all right
joey|i was i was trying to save my sandwich
chandler|from a bullet
joey|i know it doesn't make much sense…
chandler|much sense
joey|look chandler it was instinct
joey|okay
joey|i just went for it
chandler|so you risked your life for a sandwich
joey|i know it sounds crazy but chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world
chandler|so you didn't uh choose ross before me
joey|no
joey|i would never do that
joey|you you're like my brother
chandler|really
joey|yeah
joey|in fact to prove how much you mean to me here
chandler|thanks
joey|no eh oh oi easy it's not a hot dog
joey|how good is that
chandler|oh oi ho yeah
joey|see
chandler|hm hmm
joey|oh whoa hey dude what are you doing
chandler|i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me
joey|yeah
joey|with a bite
joey|gee e e eez
rachel|hey
rachel|hi
ross|rach what uh what are you doing here
rachel|hey
rachel|y'know what
rachel|you are in our apartment all the time
rachel|okay
rachel|this is this is just a drop in the bucket mister
ross|y'know it it doesn't matter
ross|the important thing is that you're here
ross|you're my friend and you're here
ross|oh
rachel|okay just a little scared
rachel|what's going on ross
ross|the most amazing thing happened tonight
ross|i thought my number was up
ross|i had an actual near death experience
rachel|what
rachel|what
rachel|what happened
ross|okay okay we were on the ride along with gary right
rachel|yeah
ross|and somebody took a shot at me
rachel|really
ross|no a car backfired but i thought somebody was taking a shot at me
ross|and rach i…i survived
ross|and i was filled with this this great respect for life
ross|y'know
ross|i i want to experience every moment
ross|i want to seize every opportunity
ross|i i am seeing everything so so clearly now
rachel|because a car backfired
ross|okay why are you here
rachel|well i i i don't know how this fits into your whole seizing thing but um emily called you today
ross|you talked to her
rachel|no she left a message
rachel|but it it kinda got erased
rachel|there's just something wrong with your machine
ross|well okay what what did she say
rachel|well uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh she wants you to call her
ross|wow
rachel|now that that was a good thing that i told you right
ross|huh
ross|yeah
ross|yes of course
rachel|okay
rachel|thank you
rachel|thank you
rachel|because i'm sorry all right
rachel|because y'know what
rachel|she didn't want me not important
rachel|the point is i was right
rachel|you're decision
rachel|okay
rachel|i was right
rachel|you're decision
ross|right
ross|i guess i guess i should call emily
rachel|okay no that's not the right decision
rachel|that's not that's not right no ross ross come on
rachel|i mean that woman made you miserable
rachel|okay ross do you really want to get back into that
ross|okay look yesterday i would've even considered calling her back but my ex wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience
ross|i mean that that has got to mean something
rachel|ugh ross
rachel|that was not a near death experience
rachel|that was barely an experience
ross|you weren't there
ross|okay maybe this is something that i i'm supposed to seize
ross|y'know
rachel|okay y'know what
rachel|maybe this is not about seizing stuff
rachel|maybe this is about escaping stuff
ross|huh
rachel|i mean look look today you escaped death y'know
rachel|and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily
ross|that does make sense
ross|because i do wanna seize some opportunity but i i really don't wanna see or talk to her
rachel|well there you go
ross|yeah
ross|maybe today is just close call day
rachel|close call day
ross|hey thanks rach
rachel|ohh honey no problem
rachel|okay
ross|oh wait wait wait
ross|the message is blinking
ross|maybe you didn't erase it
rachel|oh
ross| hey ross it's you
ross| oh yeah no that's that's an old message nobody needs to hear that
rachel|no
ross|hey umm was was monica here
rachel|yeah
ross|yeah i want my money back
rachel|yeah uh you you probably need that for stamps right
ross|hey pheebs has gary ever been shot at for real
phoebe|yes
phoebe|once
phoebe|yeah a little
phoebe|he kinda did it to himself
phoebe|it's not really a good story
ross|i wonder how i would react under fire y'know
ross|and not backfire but but heavy fire like i was in a war or something
monica|man i would be great in a war
monica|i mean i really i think i would make a fantastic military leader
monica|i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys
chandler|before or after you were shot by your own troops
ross|i know where joey would be
ross|he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us
chandler|yes if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches
joey|yeah hero sandwiches
phoebe|well you all know that i'm a pacifist so i'm not interested in war in any way
phoebe|but y'know what
phoebe|when the revolution comes i will have to destroy you all
phoebe|not you joey
