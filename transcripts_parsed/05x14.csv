ross|i know it's not exactly ethical but i sent him a little bribe to
monica|oh is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it

chandler|okay so now do you believe that she's attracted to me
monica|ohhh oh my god
monica|oh my god
monica|she knows about us
chandler|are you serious
monica|phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out
monica|that's the only explanation for it
