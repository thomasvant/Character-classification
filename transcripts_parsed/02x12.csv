ross|that commercial always makes me so sad
joey|yeah but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him so everything seems to work out ok

phoebe|i can see that 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and ya know the little pouty chin
phoebe|monica and the fact that they're both monkeys
ross|sometimes i wonder if i did the right thing ya know giving him away
rachel|oh ross you had to i mean he was humping everything in sight
rachel|i mean i have a malibu barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding
ross|remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat and and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it
