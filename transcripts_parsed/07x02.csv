ross|hello
other|hi is uh phoebe here
ross|uh no no she she’s out for the night
other|ohh great
ross|can i can i help you with something
other|well i don’t know
other|are you a masseur
ross|yes i am
other|great
other|dad
other|thank you so much i’ll be back to pick him up in an hour
other|so chandler your parents must’ve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged
chandler|oh yeah i should probably call them
other|i remember when we first got engaged
chandler|oh i don’t think i ever heard that story
monica|oh dad really you don’t need to…
other|well i’d gotten judy pregnant
other|i still don’t know how that happened
other|you don’t know how that happened
other|your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy
chandler|what a sweet story
monica|well at least you’re not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade halloween party
other|what
other|they wanted a scary story
monica|anyway we’re really excited about our wedding plans and well i guess pretty soon we’ll be making a big withdrawal from the monica wedding fund
monica|what
other|you tell her jack i can’t do it
monica|what happened
monica|you still have the monica wedding fund don’t you
other|we have it
other|only now we call it the beach house
monica|i don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house
other|we’re sorry honey but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you’d pay for it yourself
monica|you bought the beach house when i was 23
other|which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can’t put a price on that sweetie
other|we really do feel bad about this though
other|we started saving again when you were dating richard and then that went to hell so we redid the kitchen
monica|what about when i started dating chandler
other|well it was chandler
other|we didn’t think he’d ever propose
chandler|clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal
monica|i can’t believe it
monica|that there is no money for my wedding
other|we might still have some money if your father didn’t think it was a good idea to sell ice over the internet
other|it seemed like such a simple idea
other|stupid jack the word is stupid
other|all right enough
other|i don’t want to hear about it anymore
other|good luck chandler
ross|okay
ross|now i’m going to touch you
ross|ohh that’s soft
monica|i can’t believe this
monica|do you think that your parents could help pay for it
chandler|i don’t know my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding
chandler|she’s saving the rest for her divorce
chandler|and any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to dollywood
rachel|well what happened at dinner
