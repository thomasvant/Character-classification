rachel|hello
other|hello
rachel|gavin i just wanted to say thank you again for watching emma yesterday during the presentation
rachel|i really owe you an appology
other|for what
rachel|well when we first met you know i thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious

rachel|i was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out
other|i wasn't checking her out
other|i'm in fashion i was looking at her skirt
other|or was it pants
other|i didn't really see what happened below the ass area
rachel|oh wow you are really you're really a creep

other|are you jealous
rachel|oh yeah i'm jealous
rachel| oh gavin please please look at my ass 
rachel|stop looking at my ass
rachel|i mean i just think you are totally inappropriate ok
rachel|this is a work environment she's your subordinate
other|i thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant tag
rachel|that is totally different for two reasons
rachel|one i didn't know that you knew that
rachel|and two i wasn't some creep staring at his ass we had a deap meaningful relationship
other|huh

rachel|it was
rachel|oh my god
rachel|he didn't have a last name
rachel|it was just tag 
rachel|you know like cher or you know moses
other|but it was a deap meaningful relationship
rachel|oh you know what my first impression of you was absolutely right

monica|they've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk it's not so good
other|i think it's sweet
other|bye emma wemma demma
rachel|hey listen joey about molly i really prefer if you didn't go after her
joey|why not
rachel|because it took us months to find a good nanny and i wouldn't want anything to you know drive her away
joey|so what you think i'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable
joey|yeah sounds about right
ross|come on there are plenty of other women out thereok

ross|come on man i'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two but for now can you please just do this for me
chandler|allright fine but don't blame me if it doesn't work
chandler|because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something more often than not he's going to have s x with it
