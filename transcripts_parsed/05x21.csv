ross|on a cat
joey|it is not a cat
rachel|all right listen ball boys
rachel|my grandmother had one of these when i was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing
rachel|i mean it was so cute it would sit in my lap and purr all day long and i would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it
ross|free cats do that too yknow
ross|which reminds me if i might get a little political here support your local animal shelter
ross|pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from you get a much better deal from the shelter plus they probably will not die on you in a week and a half
ross|if you want a leash go to the pet shop
