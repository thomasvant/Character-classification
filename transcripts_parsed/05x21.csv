joey| 
rachel|yes it is
ross|why is it inside out
rachel|excuse me
rachel|but this is a purebred show quality sphinx cat
ross|how much did you pay for that

ross|yeah
ross|how much
rachel|a thousand bucks
ross|on a cat
joey|it's not a cat
rachel|all right listen ball boys
rachel|my grandmother had one of these when i was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing
rachel|i mean it was so cute it would sit in my lap and purr all day long and i would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it
ross|free cats do that too y'know
ross| which reminds me if i might get a little political here support your local animal shelter
ross|pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from you get a much better deal from the shelter plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half
ross|if you want a leash go to the pet shop
ross|if you want the dog for that leash go to the shelter and save it's life
ross|now back to regularly scheduled programming
