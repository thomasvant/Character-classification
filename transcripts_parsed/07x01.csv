monica|my sweet sixteen
monica|remember you went to third base with my cousin charlie
chandler|ahh third base
monica|it’s all everybody at the party could talk about
rachel|monica y’know what
rachel|the only reason i did that was because your party was so boring
monica|we had a caricaturist
rachel|oh
rachel|monica your sweet sixteen was like a million years ago
monica|and yet here we are doing it again
rachel|ugh monica i don’t want to steal your stupid thunder
monica|oh please
monica|why else would you have made out with ross
ross|got me
rachel|all right easy mimey the moment has passed it ain’t gonna happen
monica|i just thought it would be nice if i could have just this one night
rachel|i swear i never wanted any part of your night
monica|oh is that why you did it in the secret hallway where nobody ever goes
ross|uh rachel i’ve been thinking
ross|i don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea
ross|i’m calling it off
chandler|why to save your dignity my man
rachel|monica why
rachel|why would i ever want to take away from your night
monica|i don’t know
monica|i don’t maybe you’re feeling a little resentful
monica|maybe ah maybe you thought you’d get married first
monica|maybe you can’t stand the fact that your formerly fat friend is getting married before you
rachel|oh wow
rachel|that y’know what
rachel|that is so unfair
rachel|y’know what
rachel|now i want to steal your thunder
rachel|come on ross let’s go have s x
