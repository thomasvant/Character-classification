joey|i mean lying is basically just acting and i am a terrfic actor
other|you are a terrific actor

rachel|oh we just put her down for a nap
other|oh i was just thinking
other|you know what would be incredible
other|if you guys died
other|thank you amy
other|no no then i would get the baby
other|i mean you know it would be just like a movie
other|like at first i wouldn't know what to do with her then i would rise to the occasion and and then i would get a makeover and then i'd get married
phoebe|thats a great movie
phoebe| she claps 
other|now listen not that you guys could stop me or anything cause you know you'd be dead
other|i was thinking about changing her name
other|i'm just not really a big fan of emily
ross|emma
other|emma ross wants you
phoebe|phoe be
other|why does she keep making that noise
rachel|honey i don't know how to tell you this but um if something were to happen to ross or to myself ross and rachel knock on wood um you wouldn't get the baby
other|well who would
ross|well we haven't offically asked them yet but we would want monica and chandler
chandler|i can't believe you'd want us to raise emma
monica|yeah oh my god i'm so moved
other|i don't believe this hold on a second
other|you guys die and i don't get your baby
rachel|see look amy we're a lot closer to monica and chandler
rachel|we see them every day
rachel|and truthfully honey you don't seem very connected to the baby
other|connected
other|i mean
other|to what
other|she's
other|she's a lump
chandler|you know guys i got to say
chandler|this means so much to me
chandler|that you would trust me with your child
chandler|i mean we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own
chandler|you know i've had my doubts about my skills as a father but that you two
chandler|that you two
chandler| starts to cry 
other| points to chandler this guy
other|seriously
monica|okay
monica|it's time for dinner
monica|everyone we're using our fancy china
monica|um and its very expensive so please be careful
other|woah
other|woah
other| nearly really drops the plate and more seriously woah
monica|okay just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved
monica| pinches ross' arm 
joey|hey
joey|how come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's
joey|do you not trust me with a fancy plate
monica|no honey its
monica|thats a special plate
monica|see its a game whoever gets that plate wins
joey|i can't believe i won
other|its such a slap in the face
other|i'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me
rachel|monica is ross' sister
other|no ross' sister was really fat
monica|that was me
other|no she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow rachel around like a puppy dog
rachel|hey
rachel|amy
rachel|you've got to stop doing that
other|okay listen i know you're having a little bit of a family crisis but you don't have to take it out on the plates
other|i mean i mean in fact i think that everyone should cut their food like this
monica|now see this way you protect the plate
monica|and lets face it you have fun
other|okay how about this you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies then do i get the baby
chandler|no if crazy plate lad
chandler| sees monica frustrated at this comment if monica dies then i would get emma right
rachel|well actually
chandler|actually what
ross|well
ross|its just
ross|its just in that case then um
ross|emma would go to my parents
chandler|what
other|hurts doesn't it
other|uh
other|who has to die for me to get her
chandler|so if monica's not around then i'm not good enough to raise emma
other|no that that is not what we're saying
joey|yeah he's lying
joey|he looked down
chandler|well what is wrong with me
chandler|am i
chandler|am i incomptent
chandler|because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you
rachel|honey you're taking this the wrong way
rachel|we think you're going to be a wonderful parent
rachel|it's just
rachel|you're more the fun parent
ross|yeah and we'd want to make sure emma has someone like monica who is more uh
ross|uh discliplinarin
ross|someone who can be firm and strict
monica|thats not how you see me is it
other|no you're all about the fun
chandler|look i may not know a lot about babies but do you really think i'm not capable
ross|no you both are equally capable
ross|its just
ross|you're strongest when
ross|when you're together
chandler|ok
chandler|so if we both had emma and i die knocks on table she'd have to give her up
ross|sure monica would have to give her up
joey|i lie better then that right
chandler|so
chandler|let me get this straight
chandler|so my two friends die i get emma
