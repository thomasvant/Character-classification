joey|huh
joey|and what about this denise is she cute
chandler|pheebs i don’t understand
chandler|how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about

phoebe|i talk about her all the time
phoebe|denise
joey|hey rach listen i was thinkin’ uh i’m gonna have an extra room over at my place
rachel|oh that’s true

chandler|i thought naked thursday’s was just our thing man
phoebe|hey
ross|hey
phoebe|so what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her
ross|oh that
ross|umm she took it really well
phoebe|you didn’t tell her did you
ross|no
phoebe|of course not because you’re in love with her
ross|i am not in love with her
ross|she was very upset about having to move out so i eh didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset
ross|i i just comforted her as a friend
phoebe|what do you mean comforted her
ross|it’s nothing i just gave her a hug
phoebe|ah ha
phoebe|a classic sign of love the hug
ross|it’s also a sign of friendship
phoebe|yeah not in your case lovey loverson
ross|it was a hug
phoebe|okay just tell me this did you or did you not smell her hair
ross|s s smell her hair
ross|what if i did
phoebe|ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head
phoebe|that’s why that’s why women are shorter
phoebe|so that men will fall in love when they hug them
phoebe|oh come on ross you’re a scientist
ross|i was hugging her as a friend
ross|it’s not my fault her her hair got in my face she’s got a lot of it and it smells all all uh coconutty
ross|what
ross|oh that doesn’t mean i have feelings for rachel
ross|maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts
phoebe|okay whatever you say
phoebe|but just be careful all right
phoebe|rachel’s not in the same place you are
ross|if the place you are referring too is being in love then she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place
phoebe|okay i didn’t understand that but y’know maybe that’s ‘cause you were speaking the secret language of love
joey|hey
joey|dude some guy just called for you
chandler|who was it
joey|i don’t know
joey|how about thanks for taking the message
joey|jeez
monica|okay listen y’know when you move in rachel’s room is gonna be empty you wanna talk about what we want to do with it
chandler|sure
monica|okay i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room right
monica|with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time
monica|and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here
monica|okay whatever i really haven’t thought about it that much
chandler|well i like that idea
chandler|obviously
chandler|i was thinking maybe maybe maybe it could be a game room y’know
chandler|i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh like space invaders and asteroids for 200 the real ones
chandler|the big big ones
monica|no
chandler|okay so you mean no as in gee chandler what an interesting idea
chandler|let’s discuss it before we reject it completely
monica|oh i’m sorry
monica|of course i mean that
monica|interesting idea umm talk about it but no
chandler|so that’s it
monica|i just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room
monica|the beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques
chandler|which is why asteroids is perfect
chandler|it’s the oldest game
monica|what do you have against the beautiful guest room
chandler|i don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away
monica|are you mocking me
chandler|no i’m not mocking you or you beautiful guest room
joey|hey what’s up
chandler|nothing monica and i had a stupid fight
joey|but you’re still moving in together right
joey|because my ad came out today
chandler|wanted
chandler|female roommate non smoker non ugly

joey|i just figured y’know after living with you it’d be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate y’know
joey|someone i can learn from someone someone who’s different than me
joey|and what’s more different than me a guy who’s not 19 than say a girl who is 19
joey|enh

monica|stop it chandler
monica|i’m sorry too
chandler|really
monica|yeah
monica|oh yes
chandler|ohh
monica|listen we don’t have to make that a guest room we can think of something to do with the room together
chandler|that’s a great idea
chandler|we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room
monica|totally
chandler|we don’t have to come up with this now
monica|oh good
chandler|hey y’know what
chandler|why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room
monica|changes
chandler|yeah i mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair
monica|you’re you’re you’re gonna bring the barca lounger over here
chandler|is that a problem
monica|well it’s a set and they should probably stay together
chandler|oh that’s cool
chandler|then i’ll just bring them both over
monica|see now now you’re taking them away from their home
chandler|okay i get it
chandler|so i get nothing
chandler|nothing here is mine
chandler|everything here is yours
chandler|i’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes and head off to work
monica|yeah yeah y’know what
monica|yeah that’s it that’s it everything will be mine
monica|nothing will be yours
monica|that’s that’s what i said
monica|oh come on chandler
monica|i’m talking about the barca lounger
monica|it just it doesn’t match
monica|where is it gonna go
chandler|in the game room
monica|look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly
chandler|all right
chandler|that’s fine
chandler|that’s fine
chandler|i won’t bring over the chairs
chandler|i won’t bring anything over
chandler|i wouldn’t want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandma’s place
joey|everything on your application looks really good ohh
joey|just one last question umm are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out
other|oh don’t worry i’m not really a party girl
joey|whoa
joey|now look don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out
joey|i want you to really think about your answers
joey|okay
chandler|you can call off the roommate search
chandler|hi
chandler|i’ll be living here
joey|oh don’t listen to him he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment but i don’t think he’s gonna get it
chandler|why did you take the shower curtain down
joey|that thing was a hazard
joey|i’m very safety conscious
rachel|hey
ross|hey
ross|oh listen i was just clearing some space for your stuff
rachel|oh thanks but listen i was just at monica’s and she and chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in
ross|what do you mean they’re not moving in

rachel|no no they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room
ross|what
ross|over a stupid room
rachel|yeah i feel kinda bad for them but i’m also really psyched ‘cause i don’t have to move in here
ross|oh no yeah no that part’s great
ross|what’s all this about you guys fighting
ross|is this really over a room
ross|i mean that is so silly
monica|ross we can handle this
ross|well apparently not and i can’t just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly
ross|i mean enough of the silliness
chandler|well why don’t you tell her to stop being silly
ross|okay okay
ross|two very good points look i’ve known you both a long time and i’ve never seen either of you one millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together
ross|do you really want to throw that all away over a room
ross|that is so silly
ross|now wh what is more important love or silliness
chandler|well we are fond of the silliness but we also have a soft spot for the love
monica|love is the best medicine
chandler|that’s laughter
monica|why do you do it
chandler|i don’t know
ross|okay
ross|all right
ross|now chandler you you wanna live with monica right

ross|you move in you start fighting over stupid game rooms next thing y’know you break up
monica|ross you were right before it was just a stupid fight about a room
ross|okay there are no stupid fights
ross|this isn’t about the room this is about what the room represents
ross|and unfortunately this room could destroy you
chandler|yeah that’s not worried
chandler|transcriber’s note i think that’s what he says if anyone thinks any different let me know
