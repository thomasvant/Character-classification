chandler|yes and i was saying the actual words
monica|big deal so joeys had a lot of girlfriends
monica|that does not mean he is good in bed
chandler|we share a wall
chandler|so either he is great in bed or she just liked to agree with him a lot

phoebe|oh ooh
phoebe|erotery
other|hey
other|okay
other|well thanks for coming out to see me
other|i just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person
phoebe|okay
other|i really do not think it is a very good idea phoebe
phoebe|why not
other|well because you had be giving up a baby
other|and uh i do not know if there is anything i can say that can make you understand the pain of giving up a baby so um
phoebe|oh i understand
phoebe|do not do not hurt the puppy
other|no no the puppy is for you
phoebe|oh i get a puppy
other|well yeah
other|but only for three days
phoebe|why
other|well you know i realize that i do not have any right to start getting all parenty on you and everything but um er
other|phoebe would you please look at me and not the puppy it is very important
phoebe|okay
other|i mean i know what talking about
other|i gave up two babies
other|and i only wish that i had someone there who had given up babies who could have told me how terrible it is to give up a babies
other|i just think it would be something that you would regret every day for the rest of your life
other|so however hard it is for you to give up this puppy it would be like a million times harder to give up a child
phoebe|mom i really should not have given you the puppy first
phoebe|all right it is okay
