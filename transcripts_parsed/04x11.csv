phoebe|i know
ross|pheebs you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot
ross|i mean morning sickness uh labour
ross|and it's all for somebody else
phoebe|yeah what's your point
ross|the stuff i just mentioned
rachel|wow i don't know if i could ever do that
rachel|you know i always figured the first time i had a baby it would be with someone i love and that baby would be like a keeper
phoebe|you know you guys were a lot more supportive when i wanted to make denim furniture
joey|pheebs listen if you decide to do this we'll be supportive like crazy
monica|we just want you to think it through
rachel|why don't you talk to someone who's had a baby
rachel|like your mom
phoebe|my mom never gave birth
phoebe|oh but my birth mom did
other|mmmm i love this tushie

monica|in the beginning you know where it's all s x and talking and s x and talking
chandler|yeah you've you've got to love the talking
monica|and the s x
chandler|oh we haven't had s x yet
chandler|okay but what's the big deal you know
chandler|this is special and i want our love to grow before we move to the next level
rachel|chandler that is so nice
ross|yeah that is nice
ross|lying
ross|no way is that the reason
rachel|why just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that
chandler|no he's right i'm totally lying
monica|then what is it
chandler|well kathy's last girlfriend was joey
ross|and you're afraid you won't be able to fill his shoes 
chandler|no i'm afraid i won't be able to make love as well as him
ross|yeah i was going for the metaphor
chandler|yes and i was saying the actual words
monica|big deal so joey's had a lot of girlfriends
monica|that doesn't mean he's good in bed
chandler|we share a wall
chandler|so either he's great in bed or she just liked to agree with him a lot
monica|sweetie with you it's going to be different
monica|the s x is going to be great 'cause you guys are in love
chandler|yeah
rachel|yeah
ross|just go for it chandler
other|yeah you should
chandler|all right all right i'll sleep with my girlfriend

other|y yeah
other|mostly nudes
other|it combines my two passions pottery and erotica
phoebe|oh ooh
phoebe|erotery
other|hey
other|okay
other|well thanks for coming out to see me
other|i just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person
phoebe|okay
other|i really don't think it's a very good idea phoebe
phoebe|why not
other|well because you'd be giving up a baby
other|and uh i don't know if there's anything i can say that can make you understand the pain of giving up a baby so um
phoebe|oh i understand
phoebe|don't don't hurt the puppy
other|no no the puppy is for you
phoebe|oh i get a puppy
other|well yeah
other|but only for three days
phoebe|why
other|well you know i realize that i don't have any right to start getting all parenty on you and everything but um er 
other|phoebe would you please look at me and not the puppy it's very important
phoebe|okay
other|i mean i know what i'm talking about
other|i gave up two babies
other|and i only wish that i had someone there who had given up babies who could have told me how terrible it is to give up a babies
other|i just think it would be something that you would regret every day for the rest of your life
other|so however hard it is for you to give up this puppy it would be like a million times harder to give up a child
phoebe|mom i really shouldn't have given you the puppy first
phoebe|all right it's okay
joey|oh uh would you mind sitting here
joey|i'm saving this seat for my friend ross
other|you mean dr
other|geller
joey|doctor
joey|i didn't know he had a nickname
other|oh he won't sit here
other|only the people in the white coats sit over there and only the people with the blue blazers sit over here
joey|well uh how come
other|that's just the way it is
joey|that's crazy
other|maybe it's crazy in a perfect world a world without lab coats or blazers
other|but you not in a perfect world
other|you in a museum now
other|see that scientist with the glasses
other|he and i used to play together all the time in grade school
other|hmph but now

monica|i eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me
joey|look ross really it's no big deal
joey|you know you wear a white coat i wear a blue blazer if that means we can't be friends at work then so be it
joey|i understand
joey|when i'm in a play and you're in the audience i don't talk to you right
joey|so you know it's cool
joey|i'll see you tomorrow

chandler|she was more like uh oh i see your point
chandler|i'm all right with it
chandler| 
monica|well it was the first time
monica|you know there's not always a lot of agreement on the first time

monica|okay now most guys will hit one two and three and then go to seven and set up camp
chandler|and that's bad
rachel|well if you go to disneyland you don't spend the whole day on the matterhorn
chandler|well you might if it were anything like seven
monica|all right uh the important thing is to take your time
monica|you want to hit them all and you want to mix them up
monica|you got to keep them on their toes
