rachel|i can’t
rachel|i cannot listen to anymore of this
rachel|y’know the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional
rachel|and then it’s only because they get paid 100 an hour
rachel|do you know how much money i could’ve made listening to you
rachel| 2 000
rachel|and do you know when i figured that out
rachel|while you were talking
other|what

rachel|oh… i’m sorry
rachel|i… i i don’t mean i didn’t mean to stifle you
rachel|i… this is all just a little overwhelming

phoebe|it’s a beautiful ring
chandler|no it’s not
chandler|when i looked at the other ring i could see monica’s face when i gave it to her y’know
chandler|and i could see her saying yes
chandler|when i look at this ring all i see is a ring
chandler|unless i look at it really closely and then i can see my own eye
chandler|look this is the most important thing i’m gonna do in my life
chandler|i wanna make sure it’s perfect
phoebe|okay
phoebe|there may be a way that we can get the other ring back
phoebe|‘cause i heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose
phoebe|so maybe we can get him to trade rings or something
chandler|i can’t do that
phoebe|well you certainly can’t give her that stupid gumball ring
phoebe|there he is
chandler|okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger
