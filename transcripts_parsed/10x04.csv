ross|yeah
rachel|we're having a party
monica|well can't you just have the party when we get back

rachel|that won't be her real birthday
chandler|gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was
ross|c'mon you guys this is really important to us
monica|well i'm sorry but chandler and i could really use a weekend away
monica|you know to reconnect
monica|emotionally
chandler|there's this thing i really want us to do
chandler|i read about it in maxim
rachel|well can't you just go to vermont the next day
ross|yeah we want everyone to be there
ross|as much as i hate to delay your doing weird s x stuff to my little sister
rachel|and i mean you know you guys
rachel|this is a big deal
rachel|i mean how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle
monica|all right we'll stay
monica|we can just drive up after the party
chandler|fine but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party
monica|believe me that is not why we won't be doing that
rachel|you know pheebs when i was little on my birthday my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all
phoebe|oooh i love family traditions like that
phoebe|when uhm
phoebe|when ursula and i were kids on our birthday our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food
ross|hey guys
other|hi
ross|hey i brought the camera for emma's video
rachel|oh good good
rachel|we had this idea to make a birthday video for emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18
phoebe|oh cool
phoebe|wow it's like a time capsule
ross|yeah
phoebe|oh just think
phoebe|she's gonna be watching that video on a tv that hasn't even been invented yet
phoebe|with friends who right now are just like babies
phoebe|and they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people
ross|that's the hope
ross|so is emma awake yet
rachel|oh no it's still nap time
rachel|but she'll be up soon
ross|ah and where is joey
rachel|i said it's still nap time
ross|hey there is uncle joey

joey|18 uh
ross|joey no
joey|what what
joey|it's for her hot friends
ross|when they see this you'll be 52
joey|and starting to think about settling down
rachel|hey joey will you please set this up for people to put emma's presents on

joey|yeah
joey|we were supposed to bring presents
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|i wrote emma a song
joey|oh yeah
joey|how was i supposed to know
phoebe|joey it's a birthday party
joey|yeah but for a one year old
joey|what's the point
joey|the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup
joey|just a cup with a picture of elmo on it dressed as a farmer
joey|and he's standing next to this cow and the cow says el moo 
joey|yeah
joey|that's a funny cup
monica|hey
chandler|hey hey
chandler|where's the birthday girl
rachel|oh she's still napping
chandler|oh sure she was probably up all night excited about the party she knows is happening
rachel|look i know that you guys really want to get to vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you but it really is to us ok
rachel|emma will never have a first birthday again
monica|all right
monica|you're right

rachel|no really she didn't sleep well last night so we can't wake her up
monica|are you freaking kidding me green
other|hi
ross|hey
monica|so glad you came
other|i can't believe emma is already one
other|i remember your first birthday
other|ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you
other|he pulled on his testicles so hard
other|we had to take him to the emergency room
ross|there's something you didn't know about your dad
joey|hey mr
joey|and mrs
joey|geller
joey|let me help you with that
other|thank you
joey|oh man this is great uh

other|which one are you
monica|i can't believe emma is still asleep
chandler|i know what are we gonna do
monica|i've got a plan
monica|i've got a plan

monica|you're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up
chandler|i'm not going to vermont with this monica
joey|hey pheebs you know what
joey|i was thinking
joey|since you wrote a song maybe i could do something for emma using my talents
phoebe|so you’re gonna
phoebe|hit on her
joey|no no no
joey|my talents as an actor
phoebe|oh
joey|you know i could like maybe
joey|i could do a dramatic reading of one of her books
phoebe|or you could stick a fork in an apple
joey|hey i think emma might like it
rachel|oh
rachel|emma might like what
joey|um my present
rachel|what did you get her
joey|actually we prepared performances
phoebe|separate performances
joey|but equally real
rachel|well this sounds like fun
rachel|well you know what
rachel|actually
rachel|people are getting a little antsy waiting emma to wake up from her nap so would you mind performing them once now
phoebe|sure yeah
joey|o k
rachel|all right let’s get this party started huh
rachel|joey and phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us
ross|oh great
phoebe|are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared
joey|hey i do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting
rachel|so joey what are you gonna do for us
joey|i will be doing a dramatic reading of one of emma’s books
rachel|oh ok which one
joey|uh why it’s a
joey|one of her favorites uh “riding the storm out
joey|coping with post partum depression” eesh
joey|“love you forever”
joey|love you forever
joey|by robert munsch
joey|published by firefly books
joey|printed in mexico
joey|a mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth back and forth back and forth and while she held him she sang “i’ll love you forever i’ll like you for always as long as i'm living my baby you’ll be”
joey|and while he rocked her he sang “i’ll love you forever i’ll like you for always as long as i'm living my baby you’ll be”

phoebe|from my heart to hers
phoebe|for there’s no greater gift than the gift of music
phoebe|emma
