rachel|that’s funny yeah
chandler|no no no no
chandler|that was the joke
rachel|no i know
rachel|i get it
rachel|it’s funny
chandler|no because you’re not a grandmother
rachel|no i know because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and i don’t have any of those things
rachel|that’s why it’s so funny
monica|all you had to do was buy the card
ross|hey
ross|look who’s back
ross|it’s the birthday girl
ross|how’s the birthday girl feeling
rachel|well i feel fine but i think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids
ross|what
rachel|okay
rachel|y’know what
rachel|i realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids
rachel|all i really needed was a plan
rachel|see i wanna have three kids…
phoebe|oh let me guess and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother
rachel|as i was saying… i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time i’m 35 which gives me five years
rachel|i love this plan
rachel|i wanna marry this plan
phoebe|if you could do that i’d marry the hippity hop
rachel|so if i wanna have my kid when i’m 35 i don’t have to get pregnant until i’m 34
rachel|which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes
rachel|oh wait but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant…
monica|really
monica|that long
monica|look all you want it’s happening
rachel|no so i don’t have to get married until i’m 33
rachel|that’s three years that’s three whole years oh wait a minute though
rachel|i’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding and i’d like to know the guy for a year year and a half before we get engaged… which means i need to meet the guy by the time i’m thirty
ross|which is fine
ross|because you just turned twenty eight
rachel|no
rachel|ross no
rachel|it is not fine
rachel|eh eh according to my plan i should already be with the guy i wanna marry
joey|will you quit hoggin’ it
rachel|i’m telling you it’s like watching bambi learn how to walk
ross|you’re drunk
ross|mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd
ross|maybe i’m a little drunk
