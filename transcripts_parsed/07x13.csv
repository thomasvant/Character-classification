other|you read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can

monica|i can’t believe this
other|screw it
other|i’m having one
rachel|hey chandler
chandler|hey
rachel|how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines has a rolling massage and speakers in the head rest
chandler|yeah i’d love to but i’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore
rachel|well what if i told you you can do it in my apartment
chandler|are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete
chandler|the chair that sit magazine called the chair of the year
rachel|i just purchased the la z boy e cliner 3000
chandler|that’s awesome
chandler|that’s great
chandler|what made you do it
rachel|well it’s a long story but umm i broke joey’s chair
chandler|whoa whoa whoa
chandler|you broke joey’s chair
rachel|yeah
chandler|i thought i broke joey’s chair
chandler|that’s why i replaced it with mine
rachel|ohhhhh
rachel|that’s how it got fixed
chandler|well what did you think that that elves came in and fixed it
rachel|noo
rachel|angels
chandler|i’m gettin’ my chair back
rachel|what
rachel|wh hey
joey|well it looks like it wasn’t heeled after all
joey|yeah
joey|so i guess this chair is mine now
chandler|joey you broke my chair
joey|your chair
rachel|yeah he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs
joey|so there was no miracle
rachel|no joe no miracle
joey|oh no this is devastating
joey|my faith is shaken
joey|i’m so glad i have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life
rachel|uh huh
rachel|nice try but you don’t get that chair anymore
rachel|all right
rachel|that is my chair now
rachel|you can sit on my lap
rachel|no i take that back
chandler|i think i should get the chair
joey|how do you figure
chandler|because you broke a chair and you broke a chair
chandler|the only one around here that hasn’t broke a chair is me
rachel|no no no
rachel|this chair’s not going anywhere
chandler|well where’s the logic in that
rachel|the logic is that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half
chandler|so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing
joey|that’s right
chandler|what are you guys
chandler|like a gang or something
joey|yeah

phoebe|this isn’t even my regular job
phoebe|okay
phoebe|and my first day on the job you’re my first call

phoebe|my mom killed herself
other|really
phoebe|yes
other|how
phoebe|i’m not gonna give you tips
phoebe|look don’t you see that this this this all came together so that i could stop you from doing this
other|couldn’t it just be a coincidence
phoebe|no it’s fate
other|it doesn’t really seem like enough to be fate
phoebe|oh

phoebe|these jerks might not care about you but the universe does
phoebe|and that says a lot

monica|you love ross more than me
monica|and i just rubbed a dead mouse on my face
other|sweetheart we love you just as much as ross
