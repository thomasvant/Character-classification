ross|he seems to think we’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding
other|we don’t have to
ross|whoa whoa what
ross|you found a place
other|no
other|but monica and i were talking and and i was so upset about the hall being knocked down and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit
ross|she said what
other|she said if i’m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day well then we should just postpone it
ross|postpone it
ross|emily do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding
ross|do you my sister’s teeny tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here huh
ross|this isn’t right
other|i realize that people are going to be disappointed
other|but i’m sure they’ll come back when we can do it right
ross|i can’t ask people to do that
ross|would you ask people to do that
other|don’t you point your pants at me
other|we have no choice
other|anywhere that’s half decent would’ve be booked months ago ross don’t you understand
other|this is our wedding i’m talking about
ross|the only thing i understand is postponing it is not an option
ross|this is when we’re getting married
other|so what are you saying
other|it’s now or never
ross|no
ross|i’m saying it’s now
other|or
ross|there’s no ‘or’ in mind
ross|what is wrong with these pants
other|it’s not the pants
other|it’s you that is backwards
other|and if and if you don’t understand how important this is to me well then perhaps we shouldn’t get married at all
ross|no wait
ross|emily
ross|no wait stop
ross|emily please
phoebe|hey
rachel|hi
phoebe|so did shopping make you feel any better about ross
rachel|manhattan does not have enough stores

rachel|i certainly did it when we were going out
phoebe|okay
phoebe|umm before we get started i just wanna say for the record that i love ross i think he’s such a great guy
phoebe|here
phoebe|okay now close your eyes
phoebe|and imagine that you’re with ross okay and imagine that you’re kissing him
phoebe|and you’re you’re running your hands all over his body
phoebe|and then you run your hands through his hair but eew oh gross it’s some kind of grease it’s uck
phoebe|hah
rachel|i don’t know his uh his hair never really bothered me that much and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy
phoebe|okay this is going to be harder than i thought
