joey|isn't there any way you can keep him
ross|no no
ross|the vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some
ross|monkey lovin' he's just gonna get vicious
ross|i've just gotta get him into a zoo
joey|how do you get a monkey into a zoo
chandler|i know that one
chandler|no that's popes into a volkswagen
ross|well we're applying to a lot of them
ross|naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos y'know like uh san diego
ross|right
ross|but that might just be a pipe dream because y'know he's out of state
ross|uh my vet uh knows someone at miami so that's a possibility
chandler|yeah but that's like two blocks away from the beach
chandler|i mean it's a total party zoo
phoebe|hey

phoebe|popes in a volkswagen
phoebe|i love that joke
rachel|no way
rachel|no way did you do this
other|monana was very brave
monica|it was so wild
monica|we told them we were the gunnersens in room six fifteen
monica|only to find out the boston celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor

monica|nononononono
monica|think who you're dealing with here
monica|i mean i'm not like you
monica|i i can't even stand in front of a tap class
other|well that's just probably 'cause of your amish background
monica|what
other|well you're pennsylvania dutch right
monica|right
monica|till i bought a blow dryer then i was shunned
other|i i used to be just like you
other|and then one day i saw a movie that changed my life
other|did you ever see dead poets' society
monica|uh huh
other|i thought that movie was so incredibly
other|boring
other|i mean that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play
other|what was that
other|it's like kid wait a year leave home do some community theatre
other|i walked out of there and i thought 'now that's two hours of my life that i'm never getting back'

joey|phoebe
joey|whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be

ross|nono he's he's very docile
other|even if he were
other|cornered

ross|he can hold a banana if that's whatcha mean
other|how about a hammer or a small blade
ross|why why why would he need a blade
other|well if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns you've got to give the little guy something
