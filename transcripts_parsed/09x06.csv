chandler|can all states have stuff like that
chandler|hey yeah from the waistband wyoming
chandler|but when i was seven we headed over to the crotch
monica|was your cabin pressurised
chandler|and do not get me started on the way that people from tulsa talk
phoebe|okay
chandler|what is with the word you all
chandler|you know just
chandler|two words just
chandler|pushed together
chandler|are we all allowed to do that because if so i say why stop there
chandler|you know your new poodle could be your noodle
chandler|and fried chicken
chandler|could be fricken
chandler|waiter waiter excuse me have the fricken

monica|well he did this bit
monica|you probably had to be there but it was liza minelli locked in our freezer eating a raw chicken
chandler|were you there
phoebe|no but it sounds like it was fricken funny
other|i really do understand how hard it is gotta be to leave your child with another person
other|i mean it is leaving behind a piece of your heart
rachel|sandy that is exactly what it is
ross|are you gay
rachel|ross
other|it is okay
other|i get that a lot doing what i do
other|but i am straight
other|i engaged actually
rachel|oh
other|her name is deliah
rachel|oh that is pretty
ross|so you are just like a
ross|guy who is a nanny
other|i realise how it is
other|a bit unorthodox for some people but i really believe the most satisfying thing you can do with your life is take care of a child
ross|okay
other|like in my last job i met daniel when he was three weeks old
other|and i got to watch him grow into this awesome person
other|when i left i said see you soon
other|and he said to me skdandy

rachel|so wh
rachel|he is smart he is qualified
rachel|give me one good reason we should not try him out
ross|because it is weird
