phoebe|yeah
phoebe| you know
phoebe|and given my life long search for irony you can imagine how happy i am
monica|what are you gonna do

phoebe|you know complicated moral situation no right no wrong
monica|you have to tell david
phoebe|okay i knew i should have had this conversation with joey

chandler|i'm funny right
chandler|what do you know you're a door
chandler|you just like knock knock jokes
chandler|save it for inside
monica|heeeeeey
chandler|hey
phoebe|hey
chandler|so
chandler|oklahoma is a crazy place
chandler|you know they call it the sooner state
chandler|frankly i'd sooner be in any other state
chandler|and what's with oklahoma having a pan handle
chandler|can all states have stuff like that
chandler|hey yeah i'm from the waistband wyoming
chandler|but when i was seven we headed over to the crotch
monica|was your cabin pressurised
chandler|and don't get me started on the way that people from tulsa talk
phoebe|okay
chandler|what's with the word y'all
chandler|you know just
chandler|two words just
chandler|pushed together
chandler|are we all allowed to do that because if so i say why stop there
chandler|you know your new poodle could be your noodle
chandler|and fried chicken
chandler|could be fricken
chandler|waiter waiter excuse me i'll have the fricken
chandler|see that's
chandler|that's funny with the fricken right
monica|no it just remind me of something this guy did today at work
monica|i told you about that funny guy geoffrey right
chandler|yeah he came up
monica|well he did this bit
monica|you probably had to be there but it was liza minelli locked in our freezer eating a raw chicken
chandler|were you there
phoebe|no but it sounds like it was fricken funny
other|i really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person
other|i mean it's leaving behind a piece of your heart
rachel|sandy that's exactly what it is
ross|are you gay
rachel|ross
other|it's okay
other|i get that a lot doing what i do
other|but i am straight
other|i i'm engaged actually
rachel|oh
other|her name is deliah
rachel|oh that's pretty
ross|so you're just like a
ross|guy who's a nanny
other|i realise how it's
other|a bit unorthodox for some people but i really believe the most satisfying thing you can do with your life is take care of a child
ross|okay
other|like in my last job i met daniel when he was three weeks old
other|and i got to watch him grow into this awesome person
other|when i left i said i'll see you soon
other|and he said to me skdandy
other|that was his name for me

rachel|oh that would be great
rachel|i love him i love him i love him
ross|oh come on rach he's a guy
rachel|so wh
rachel|he's smart he's qualified
rachel|give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out
ross|because it's weird
rachel|why
ross|what kind of job is that for a man
ross|a nanny
ross|i it's like if a woman wanted to be
rachel|yes
ross|king
other|i er
other|i hope you don't mind
other|i used some of my home made lotion on emma
other|it's a mixture of calendula and honey cream

other|plus
other|it keeps the hands young
rachel|please
rachel|yes
rachel|sandy you're hired
other|that's great
other|i'm sorry
other|it's just
other|such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family
rachel|oooh
