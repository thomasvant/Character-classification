monica|i mean from the ages 7 to 9 frannie and i were inseparable
chandler|well maybe since the age of 9 frannie’s made some new friends
ross|well l look okay it’s probably just a mistake
ross|let me call aunt sheryl okay
ross|maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail
monica|yeah well you call her and tell her that y’know when we were kids her precious little frannie tried to undress me several times okay
monica|and if i hadn’t have stopped her there probably wouldn’t even be a wedding to go to
ross|y’know she tried to undress me too
chandler|i used to undress my cousin glenn
phoebe|joseph francis tribbiani are you home yet

ross|ahh there’s there’s limited seating in the hall
monica|limited seating
monica|i am just one tiny person
ross|well yeah but she doesn’t know that
ross|i mean the last time she saw you you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling
monica|limited seating
monica|oh that is such a lame excuse
monica|that’s not the reason she’s not inviting me
ross|oh what’s the big deal
ross|i wasn’t even invited to the ceremony just the reception
ross|and and y’know what
ross|if it makes you feel any better joan and i will just make an appearance and then and then we’ll we’ll leave early as a sign of protest
monica|joan

ross|i can’t cancel on joan
monica|why not
ross|bec did you not hear me
