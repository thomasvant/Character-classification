rachel|oh
rachel|phoebe all babies are beautiful
phoebe|oh
phoebe|okay
rachel|phoebe just the idea of pitting one baby against another i mean you know and judging who's cuter just for a trophy
rachel|and a thousand dollars
rachel|is something i'm very interested in
rachel|oh please do not tell ross
rachel|he still believes that what's in the inside is important
phoebe|okay oh and emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition

chandler|why come all the way from kansas to do that
monica|i don't get older
monica|i just get better
