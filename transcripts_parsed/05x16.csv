monica|no
chandler|no it can mean anything
chandler|like uh all of the sudden you're jealous because i've become the apartment stud

monica|um hmm
chandler|joey look are you attracted to monica
chandler|right here right now are you attracted to her

joey|i mean yeah i can get a girlfriend
joey|yeah we could sit in the chair and do crosswords but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like like you guys have

joey|uh i was just over there talking to monica and chandler boy they are really tight
rachel|i know
joey|yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there
joey|i'm thinking of getting me one of those
rachel|what's up joe
joey|well the reason i think monica and chandler are so great…
rachel|yeah
joey|…is because they were friends first
joey|y'know
joey|so i asked myself who are my friends
joey| you and phoebe and i saw you first
joey|so…
rachel|what are you saying
joey|i'm saying maybe you and i crank it up a notch
rachel|y'know honey umm as uh as flattered as i am that uh you saw me first uhh i just i i don't think we should be cranking anything up
joey|i'll treat you real nice
rachel|yeah well y'know umm… no honey listen i think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them but i think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone become their friend build a foundation then you ask them out on a date
rachel|don't hit on your existing friends
joey|won't won't that take longer
rachel|yeah
rachel|yeah
