rachel|ok well this is like that
rachel|in no way
rachel|i had a
rachel|i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey
monica|wow do you mean like kiss him kiss him
rachel|oh yeah
rachel|i mean that was pretty intense
monica|what do you think brought than on
rachel|i don't know
rachel|i mean maybe that's something to do with the fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday
monica|a love scene
monica|with who
rachel|olivia
monica|olivia
monica|i thought she was marrying connor
monica|oh right real life more important
rachel|so do you think that my dream means anything
monica|i don't know
monica|i mean you saw him do a love scene so maybe you don't have a thing for joey maybe you have a thing for drake
rachel|ah
rachel|well it was joey reading drake's lines in the dream
monica|of course it was
monica|trust me when it comes to psychology i know what i'm talking about
monica|i took two psych classes in college
rachel|you took the same class twice
monica|it was hard
phoebe|hey
other|hi
phoebe|here monica look what i got to wear when i play at the restaurant uh huh wait
phoebe|right
phoebe|i mean this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man
monica|oh
monica|phoebe
monica|maybe i wasn't clear before
monica|i really love listening to your music here but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place
phoebe|right yeah ok i'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault
monica|phoebe it's not what you wear
monica|it's sort of your songs
monica|i just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore
phoebe|oh ok
phoebe|fine i'll just i'll take the hat back
rachel|hey so you guys the funniest thing happened at work
phoebe|my songs aren't good enough for your restaurant
rachel|ok we're still on that
monica|i didn't say your songs were not good enough
phoebe|then what's wrong with them
phoebe|would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food
monica|tiny portions
phoebe|yeah well excuse me i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer but i can't see it i can't see it 
monica|phoebe it's not about quantity
phoebe|well
phoebe|it's not about quality
monica|oh really you want to talk about quality
monica|have you heard of a key
monica|it's what some people sing in
phoebe|well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic
phoebe|yeah there are other ingredients monica
monica|ok so that's what we're doing
monica|you know when i'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs i'm wearing ear plugs
phoebe|ear plugs or cloves of garlic
monica|you know what
monica|i take back what i said before
monica|you keep playing at the restaurant because with your music driving people inside my bar sales are going up like crazy
phoebe|what are people having the garlic martini
other|here's your copy of the bill we hope you enjoyed your stay
chandler|oh we did and you still have all your lamps
chandler|oh i didn't factor in the room tax
ross|oh dude don't worry about it i found an unattended maid's car

phoebe|the food here at 'javu'
phoebe|will kill you
monica|thank god it's just you
monica|i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall
phoebe|you'd better get back in that kitchen monica the garlic is not gonna overuse itself
monica|ok you have to stop playing now
phoebe|why
phoebe|the only person my playing is bothering is you
monica|oh yeah
monica|ok let's settle this come on
phoebe|get your garlic peelers off me
monica|excuse me excuse me hi i'm monica geller
monica|i'm the head chef here
monica|ok i was actually expecting a little applause there but whatever
monica|ok quick question by a show of hands how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside
phoebe|ok ok how many of you enjoyed the music outside
phoebe|ha
monica|alright let me ask you this question how many of you thought the music was fine but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant
phoebe|ok well who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky
monica|ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone
phoebe|ok well alright who thinks the food is fine the music was fine but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking
monica|excuse us
monica|alright here's a question who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now
phoebe|oh
phoebe|who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great
monica|i'm sorry
phoebe|i'm sorry too
monica|ooohh
monica|hey
monica|wanna stick around and i'll whip you up some dinner
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|as long as it's free
phoebe|food here is ridiculously over p
phoebe|who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me
rachel|hey
joey|hey
rachel|joey do you have peanut butter on the back of your head
joey|oh man
joey|i thought i got it all
rachel|how
rachel|how
joey|i was making a peanut butter smoothy right
rachel|uh huh
joey|and i couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender
joey|and i thought
joey|well
joey|how important can that be right
joey|turns out very
rachel|wow
rachel|definitely just drake
joey|what
rachel|what
rachel|how is it going with drake
joey|oh
joey|i don't think it's going very well
rachel|what
rachel|that scene i saw was so good
joey|well i'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow
rachel|joey is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so i'll give you a compliment
joey|a little
joey|yeah no i really am worried you know i mean i have to make it convincing that i'm in love with olivia
rachel|so
joey|so
joey|i've never played that
rachel|ooh
rachel|honey it can't be that hard i mean you've been in love before
joey|uh
joey|well
joey|just once
joey|with you
rachel|ok
rachel|this could be a little awkward
rachel|i'm just going to blow past it
rachel|well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance
joey|what the hell are you talking about
rachel|alright alright look just uh
rachel|just try to remember how you felt when you were in love and think about that when you're playing the scene
joey|oh
joey|ok yeah i think i can do that
joey|yeah ok there's this party scene coming up
joey|and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her but he can't
joey|and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you but you didn't know so i would just pretend everything was cool but really it was killing me
rachel|joey you never
rachel|you never talked about that before
joey|well
joey|hey you know what else i could use
joey|there's a scene where drake sneaks into olivia's bedroom and she doesn't know he's there which never happened with us
joey|and he knows he shouldn't be there but he just wants to look at her
joey|you know
joey|and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your make up when i would think to myself my god she
joey|is
joey|beautiful
joey|and it hurts so much cuz i knew i could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you
joey|thanks dude
joey|this is great
chandler|i got you something from vermont
monica|besides tampons and salt
monica|ooh
monica|my god
