phoebe|oh i want to look too
phoebe|yikes
monica|so do you think that these pictures are are they trying to tell a story
rachel|oh yeah sure
rachel|i mean like in the case of this young woman she has lost her clothes so she rides naked on the horse she’s crying out ‘where are they where are they
rachel|’
monica|well she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that
phoebe|oh yeah
phoebe|aw remember the days when you used to go out to the barn lift up your shirt and bend over
other|yeah
rachel|you see now i would date this girl
rachel|she’s cute she’s outdoorsy you know and she knows how to build a fire

rachel|i don’t know
monica|me neither
phoebe|rachel
monica|what
phoebe|i don’t know
phoebe|me neither
joey|you forget how many great songs heart had
chandler|yeah
ross|you know barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard
chandler|so you heard it you repeated it so that must mean you wrote it
joey|oh you guys with this joke
joey|i gotta say i know i cracked up but i’m not even sure i got it
ross|what you didn’t get it
ross|the doctor is a monkey
chandler|and monkeys can’t write out prescriptions
chandler|you are not allowed to laugh at my joke
ross|your joke
ross|well i think ‘the hef’ would disagree which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah dollars
chandler|so you stole my joke and you stole my money
ross|well i was going to stick it in the atm but now i think i’ll show the sexy teller that i am a published writer
chandler|well she is going to know that you stole the joke
ross|oh what are you going to do follow me down there
chandler|yeah
ross|well i’m not going to go now anyway
chandler|okay
other|here you go
joey|ah gunther i can’t pay for this right now because i’m not working so i’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh payin’ for stuff
other|well if you want you can work here
joey|uh i don’t know
joey|ya see it’s just see i was a regular on a soap opera y’know
joey|and to go from that to this i just… plus i’d have to wait on all my friends
other|okay but the money’s good plus you get to stare at rachel as much as you want
joey|what
other|flexible hours
joey|maybe i could be a waiter
joey|could i use the phone
monica|she picked rachel
monica|i mean she tried to back out of it but it was obvious
monica|she picked rachel
chandler|he took my joke he took it
monica|it’s wrong
monica|you know what else is wrong
monica|phoebe picking rachel
chandler|you know who else picked rachel
chandler|ross and you know what else ross did
chandler|he stole my joke
chandler|you know what
chandler|i’m going to get a joke journal
chandler|y’know
chandler|and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes
monica|that’s a good idea
chandler|yeah
monica|do you know what’s a bad idea
chandler|picking rachel

monica|did you hear something
chandler|maybe it’s the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts
monica|it’s coming from the living room
joey|i finished my book
monica|hey you guys
other|hey
monica|oh don’t you guys look cute
monica|you guys make such a cute couple
rachel|monica what are you doing

monica|that was funny
phoebe|i guess it was kinda funny
monica|it wasn’t funny at all
monica|why would you do that
monica|why didn’t you pick me
phoebe|fine
phoebe|the reason that i was leaning a little bit more toward rachel than you is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance okay let’s go to lunch

monica|you think i’m high maintenance
monica|okay prove it
monica|i want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point
phoebe|no okay you’re right

other|okay i’ll see you in an hour
joey|oh man i could totally get that part
joey|‘i’m sorry that seat is taken
joey|’
other|oh excuse me
joey|no no i didn’t mean you
joey|but you believed me huh
other|i believed you were saving this seat for someone
joey|so you’d hire me right
other|for what
joey|exactly
joey|all right everybody listen up
joey|the coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour
other|huh
other|what
joey|yeah it’s for the kids
joey|to keep the kids off drugs
joey|it’s a very important issue in this month’s playboy
joey|i’m sure you all read about it
ross|it’s my joke
chandler|it’s my joke
other|it’s my joke
ross|y’know i don’t think we’re going to settle this
chandler|let’s have monica decide
ross|yeah
chandler|yeah
ross|hey mon
chandler|mon get out here
ross|monica
chandler|okay okay
chandler|you have to help us decide whose joke this is
monica|why do i have to decide
chandler|because you’re the only one that can be fair
ross|yeah
monica|i can’t be fair
monica|you’re my boyfriend
ross|yeah but i’m your brother
ross|we’re family
ross|that’s the most important thing in the world
chandler|don’t try to sway her
chandler|i’m your only chance to have a baby
chandler|okay let’s go
ross|we’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth me
monica|okay chandler you go first
chandler|okay i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve
monica|oh wait is he the guy i met at christmas
chandler|can i finish my story
monica|do you want me to pick you
ross|see i would never snap at you like that
monica|continue
chandler|so steve said he had to go to the doctor
chandler|and steve’s doctor’s name is doctor muppy
chandler|so i said ‘doctor monkey
chandler|’ and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up
ross|are you kidding
ross|okay look
ross|i i studied evolution
ross|remember evolution
ross|monkey into man
ross|plus i’m a doctor and i had a monkey
ross|i’m doctor monkey
chandler|i’m not arguing with that
monica|all right i’ve heard enough
monica|i’ve made my decision
monica|you are both idiots
monica|the joke is not funny and it’s offensive to women and doctors and monkeys
monica|you shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world
monica|now let it go
monica|the joke sucks
ross|it’s your joke
chandler|is not
monica|hi chandler
monica|there you are
chandler|hi oh hi
monica|hey it’s phoebe and rachel
monica|um why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance
chandler|monica is a self sufficient together lady
chandler|being with her has been like being on a vacation
chandler|and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and generosity of spirit
rachel|wow you know what
rachel|that is the best fake speech i think i’ve ever heard
phoebe|really
phoebe|i’ve heard better
monica|wait wait he came up with that himself
monica|tell them chandler
chandler|i’m out of words
chandler|should i just say the whole thing again
monica|look i am not high maintenance
monica|i am not
monica|chandler
chandler|you’re a little high maintenance
monica|ahhh
monica|you are on my list
chandler|i’m sorry
chandler|you’re not easy going but you’re passionate and that’s good
chandler|and when you get upset about the little things i think that i’m pretty good about making you feel better about that
chandler|and that’s good too
chandler|so they can say that you’re high maintenance but it’s okay because i like … maintaining you
monica|i didn’t even tell him to say that
monica|all right you’re off my list
chandler|i’m off the list
monica|phoebe it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because i have the best boyfriend
phoebe|y’know suddenly i find you very attractive
chandler|hey buddy boy how’d the audition go
joey|not good no
joey|i didn’t get the part and i lost my job here so …
phoebe|wow
phoebe|that is a bad audition
rachel|how how did you lose your job here
joey|well i had the audition but gunther said i had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed
joey|so i went anyway and then he fired me
rachel|he left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days
rachel|that’s not that’s not right
joey|yeah what are ya gonna do
rachel|joey you can’t let him get away with that
rachel|ya know what i’m not going to let him get away with that
rachel|i’m going to say something to him no i really shouldn’t say anything no i should say something to him
rachel|gunther i want you to give joey his job back
rachel|that is really not fair that you have to fire him…
other|okay
rachel|what
other|he can have his job back
rachel|that’s right he can have his job back
rachel|i’m glad we got that all straightened out
rachel|there you go joey you got your job back
