rachel|i dunno
rachel|y’know to me he’ll always be “jack geller walks in while you’re changing
rachel|”
monica|y’know dad chandler is one of ross’s very best friends
chandler|yeah ross sure is a great guy y’know i’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father
other|i always thought that too
other|tell me what does your father do
chandler|he’s the headliner of a gay burlesque show
joey|rach you’re killin’ us here will ya serve the dessert already
joey|those drunken dancers are waiting

rachel|it’s a trifle
rachel|it’s got all of these layers
rachel|first there’s a layer of ladyfingers then a layer of jam then custard which i made from scratch then raspberries more ladyfingers then beef sauteed with peas and onions then a little more custard and then bananas and then i just put some whipped cream on top
ross|w what was the one right before bananas
rachel|the beef

chandler|why did you do that
ross|i don’t know aheh your’s was the first name that that popped into my head i’m i’m sorry
ross|i i didn’t think it would matter
chandler|how could it not matter
ross|how was i supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college let alone you you would be living with my sister
chandler|what about all that “friends forever” stuff
ross|i don’t know i i was all high
monica|mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get ross stoned
chandler|your parents caught ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me
monica|ross i can’t believe you’d do that
chandler|the reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me okay
chandler|so will you fix this
