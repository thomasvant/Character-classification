ross|gimme the bottle
ross|gimme the towel
chandler|howdy
joey|gimme a box a juice
joey|well they switched me over to hombre
chandler|well maybe it's because of the way you're dressed
joey|or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it
joey|you should see this guy chandler he goes through two bottles a day
chandler|what do you care
chandler|you're an actor
chandler|this is your day job
chandler|this isn't supposed to mean anything to you
joey|i know but i was the best you know
