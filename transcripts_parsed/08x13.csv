monica|hello
chandler|i’m in the bathroom can you come in here
chandler|i think there’s something wrong

monica|i i think i’ll wait out here
chandler|i’m in the bathtub
monica|oh
monica|what’s wrong
chandler|i drew my own bath but i did it wrong
chandler|the water’s tepid
chandler|the salt didn’t dissolve and is now lodged places
chandler|and the scents i used don’t compliment each other
chandler|eucalyptus and chamomile oh
monica|what
chandler|the bath salts
chandler|they’re starting to effervesce
chandler|it’s different
chandler|it’s interesting
monica|okay let’s talk about something else
chandler|yeah
chandler|sure sure
chandler|so what was going on with you today
chandler|oh oh oh
monica|well i actually had the weirdest conversation with joey
monica|he was talking about rules and right and wrong and
chandler|i had the exact same conversation
monica|you did
monica|what was he talking about
chandler|i don’t know
chandler|joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in macbeth
monica|that was a long night
chandler|all right let’s break this down
chandler|what exactly did he say to you
monica|okay he was talking about rules
chandler|uh huh
monica|umm and looking at people differently
chandler|he didn’t say anything about that to me
monica|what did he tell you
chandler|he was asking all these questions about you me and london
chandler|and of course the glue that holds this all together the rules
monica|okay
monica|so you me and london
monica|looking at people differently
monica|maybe he wants to do what you and i did in london with someone
chandler|but what did he mean by rules
monica|wait a minute
monica|he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in
chandler|because he was looking at her differently
monica|and phoebe is his friend so he thinks that would be breaking the rules
chandler|my god
chandler|he wants to do it with phoebe in london
phoebe|you guys
monica|just a minute
monica|that’s mrs
monica|tribbiani
chandler|you don’t say anything
monica|why would i say anything
monica|that two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives
monica|and they would have me to thank and we could all start having babies
chandler|i’m not going to let you say anything
monica|you just stay here
chandler|oh god
phoebe|oh hey monica i brought back your iron
monica|oh you had that
phoebe|uh huh
monica|i thought i lost it
monica|i got a new one like a month ago
phoebe|oh just as well i broke this one
phoebe|what
monica|nothing
phoebe|okay
monica|i mean i i i really shouldn’t say
monica|i mean i’m really not supposed to
phoebe|fine
monica|it’s a humdinger
phoebe|then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me
monica|somebody likes you
phoebe|is it chandler
monica|no
phoebe|well then tell him to stop staring
monica|it’s joey
phoebe|really
phoebe|joey
phoebe|you don’t say
monica|is it something you’d be interested in
phoebe|i don’t know i don’t know i don’t know
phoebe|you know i mean on the one hand mother may i
phoebe|but y’know on the other hand no
phoebe|no i can’t
phoebe|we’re friends
phoebe|no oh no

phoebe|i don’t want him to get hurt
phoebe|well i must say i am on fire
phoebe|first chandler now joey

phoebe|sure
rachel|hey
ross|hey
rachel|you know what
rachel|i’ve been thinking about it
rachel|i’m really coming around on the name ruth
rachel|i think i would actually consider naming our child that
ross|rach i i can’t tell you how how much that means to me
ross|ohh wait a minute
ross|wait a minute
ross|you you hated the name ruth
ross|why why would you change your mind
ross|unless you know we’re never going to have to use it
ross|you did see the folder
ross|you know it’s a boy
rachel|i didn’t see anything
rachel|i actually changed my mind about the name
ross|i don’t think so
ross|you’re just giving me ruth so you’ll get to name it when it’s a boy and that’s when you’ll swoop in and name him heath or blaine or sequoia
rachel|i would sequoia
ross|veto
rachel|fine
ross|unless you anticipated that i would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl and you really do want her to be named ruth
ross|well i’m not falling for that
ross|okay
ross|ruth is off the table
rachel|but ross you want the name ruth
ross|not like this
