other|benji isn't in love with me
other|i mean he broke up with me

other|i'm sure he was just joking ross
ross|if you don't believe me let's go talk to him okay
ross|i'm telling you he didn't ask me one paleontological question

ross|no no no
ross|don't do that
ross|i want you to look her in the eyes and tell her the truth
other|benji
other|alright it's true
other|i behaved horribly
other|but it's only because i still love you
other|and i would do anything to have you back in my life
ross|too little too late benji
other|i can't believe this
other|i never should have broken up with you
other|i think about you all the time
other|i mean do you ever still think about me
ross|no
other|yes
ross|what
other|i don't know what to say benji
other|this is all so
other|romantic
ross|or
