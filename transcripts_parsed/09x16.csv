chandler|did you see our bank statement
chandler|can this be right
monica|i know
monica|god
monica|i haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since i was a kid and they came up with double stuffed oreos
monica|what happened to all our money
chandler|i'm not sure what they did but i'm inclined to blame enron
monica|i guess with you doing the internship we're just spending more than we're bringing in
chandler|maybe i should quit and get a job that pays
monica|oh but you're finally doing something that you love
monica|i can't ask you to give that up
monica|though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know
monica|finding gold
chandler|you know what
chandler|you know what
chandler|i think we're making too big a deal out of this
chandler|ok
chandler|so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things
chandler|and maybe we start eating out of joey's refrigerator for a change
chandler|you're chef
chandler|what can you make out of backing soda and beer
monica|ok worse case scenario is
monica|we borrow some money from my parents
chandler|no
chandler|we're not borrowing money
monica|why not
chandler|because we don't do that
chandler|we are bings
chandler|and if there's one thing my father taught me was
chandler|well to always knock before going into the pool house
chandler|but the other thing was never borrow money
monica|wow
monica|i had no idea you had this much pride
chandler|that's right
chandler|i do
chandler|and i'm your man
chandler|and i'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard
other|i'm gonna go
phoebe|why
other|i haven't been home in a couple of days and i need to get some more clothes
phoebe|oh
phoebe|you don't have to go i have something that will fit you
other|i put that tube top on as a joke
phoebe|i want you to stay
other|i want to stay too but i've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers as i can
phoebe|why don't you turn them inside ou
other|done it

phoebe|great
phoebe|ok
phoebe|i'll go get the tube top
other|no no
other|what i mean is i hate going back to my apartment now

phoebe|perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet
phoebe|except for once in the ocean
