chandler|okay she is the star of the play
chandler|and she is my girlfriend
chandler|i get to have s x with the star of the play
ross|people can hear you
chandler|i know
chandler|wow
chandler|she looks great
chandler|doesn’t she
ross|yeah
other|hi
other|hi
ross|that is one good looking man
chandler|is it just me or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat
other|sooo you’ve been doing this long
other|no you’re my first
other|put the money on the table
other|oh yeah
other|ooh that’s nice
ross|dude
other|is that an expensive blouse
other|if you want it to be
ross|here’s your girlfriend’s button
phoebe|oh hey mon do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school
monica|yeah i think i have some around here somewhere
monica|why
phoebe|well it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive
monica|hey rach
monica|i made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room
monica|if you could just……throw your purses at it
rachel|bloomingdale’s eliminated my department
monica|oh my god are you out of a job
rachel|no but they stuck me in personal shopping
rachel|which is just a huge step down
phoebe|personal shopping
phoebe|what is that
phoebe|like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy
rachel|uh huh
phoebe|that sounds great
joey|hey
monica|umm excuse me we switched apartments
monica|you can’t eat are food anymore that that gravy train had ended
joey|there’s gravy
monica|if you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time
monica|that fridge has got to be stocked okay that’s your department now
monica|what are you doing
joey|i think i left a donut up here
ross|hey
phoebe|hey
joey|hey
phoebe|ooh
phoebe|how was kathy’s play
ross|well kathy gets half naked and simulates s x with a real good lookin’ guy
chandler|yeah it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me 32 to see it
phoebe|that’s a good idea for a business
chandler|i’m totally screwed
chandler|okay they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me
chandler|y'know it’ll be like so where’s your boyfriend what’s his name chester
chandler| and she’ll go no no no it’s chandler
chandler| and he’ll go whatever
chandler|ha ha ha ha
chandler| 
joey|that that is a good trick
chandler|all right look look what am i gonna do
joey|chandler look they’re actors
joey|they’re there to do a job just ‘cause they work together doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together
joey|i mean just ‘cause it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them
ross|oh oh alec baldwin and kim basinger
joey|tom cruise and nicole kidman
ross|yeah
phoebe|hey mel gibson and clint eastwood
ross|they’re not a couple
phoebe|oh okay i get the game now
joey|okay look look let me ask you a question when they were doing it on stage was it like really hot
ross|oh yeah
joey|well okay so then you’re fine
joey|the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off stage all the sexual tension between them is gone
joey|okay
joey|so as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about
joey|it’s when the heat goes away that’s when you’re in trouble
chandler|really
joey|look you guys have been to every play i’ve ever been in have i ever had chemistry on stage
ross|no
joey|noooo
chandler|so uh man are you gonna go to the play with me tonight
ross|y’know what i don’t know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the s x is between some guy and your girlfriend
chandler|yeah i know but…
ross|oh no no no i’m there
monica|hey
joey|hey mon
joey|want some pancakes
monica|you made pancakes
joey|yep
joey|grab a plate
monica|okay
joey|no no stay right there
joey|gettin’ closer
chandler|okay okay but don’t worry because we also have cereals muffins waffles and jams jellies and marmalades
chandler|which i’m fairly certain are the same thing
joey|listen also we’re uh we’re watching the game here saturday night if people want to come over
ross|oh yeah
monica|oh i was thinking about having people over for the game
joey|oh yeah who’s playing
monica|the players
