phoebe|so you're gonna move
ross|oh my god
joey|shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this
rachel|what is wrong with raising a kid in the city
rachel|i'm doing it ross is doing it sarah jessica parker is doing it

chandler|and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice cream truck can go by
ross|so you wanna buy a house in the 50's
phoebe|have you thought about what you would be giving up
phoebe|you can't move out of the city what if you want chinese food at 5am
phoebe|or a fake rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an asian hooker sent right to your door
ross|you know what if you wanna look for a house that's okay
joey|no no it's not don't listen to him
