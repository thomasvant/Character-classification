chandler|who
monica|lewis posin
monica|he was my best friend in fifth grade and and then one day i asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no
monica|do you know why
chandler|because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom
monica|no
monica|but because he thought i was too faaaaa
monica|and every time i think about it it makes me feel as bad as i did in fifth grade
monica|y’know i i really think that you should apologize to julie
chandler|what
chandler|are you kidding
chandler|that was like 16 years ago
monica|no i know
monica|but y’know what
monica|it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me
chandler|okay i will do it
chandler|but i have to warn you this may make me a better person and that is not the man you fell in love with
joey|okay all right this is how it’s going to work
joey|we’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10 1 being the highest
ross|no 10 is the highest
joey|why is 10 the highest
ross|because it’s the highest
ross|okay rachel you’re up first
ross|situation no

ross|go
joey|i don’t want to marry chandler
rachel|okay uh
joey|i’ve got cold feet
rachel|it’s gonna be okay
joey|no one man for the rest of my life
joey|i don’t know if i can do it
joey|this means i’ll never get to sleep with joey
rachel|look monica getting cold feet is very common
rachel|y’know it’s it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love chandler
rachel|and also i ran out on a wedding

ross|why why would i care about that
joey|no reason i’m just saying that uh that’s where i’ll be
chandler|as bad as that went i actually enjoyed myself
chandler|i think that i’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things i do
monica|why don’t you just stop doing stupid things
monica|then you wouldn’t have to apologize
chandler|i would really love it if i could do both

chandler|a hundred and forty five pounds
monica|in one year
monica|my god what did she eat
monica|her her family
monica|that’s not the point
chandler|look i know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody but i was 15

monica|you remember when umm you spent thanksgiving with us
monica|you called me fat
chandler|okay
chandler|okay now wait a minute that was totally different
