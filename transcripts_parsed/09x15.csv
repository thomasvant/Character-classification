monica|hey how did the audition go

monica|what happened
joey|well he said i wasn't urgent enough you know and that everything i did was horizontal and i should be more vertical
joey|oh and he said that i should think less
monica|so far so good
chandler|honey i'm old
monica|what's wrong
chandler|i am so much older than these other interns
chandler|i can't compete with them
monica|so you're a little older
monica|try to look at the positive you have all this life experience
chandler|yes but i don't think life experience with these
joey|wooooooooow it's like they're on fire
monica|what are they
chandler|they're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can't do because no self respecting adult would ever where these
joey|i give you 500 for them
chandler|what am i supposed to do with these
monica|ah come on sneakers are easy
monica|you wear sneakers all the time
chandler|well first of all they're not called sneakers anymore
chandler|apparently they're called kicks or skids and i think i heard somebody say slorps 
chandler|and here look they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause apparently walking is too much exercise
chandler|kids kids roll your way to childhood obesity
chandler|would you help me try to sell these
monica|okay have you considered using a girl with huge knockers
chandler|no i don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for
joey|hey that'd work on me
joey|why did i get to buy mrs
joey|butterwords
ross|hey you'll never guess what just happened… phoebe and i got mugged
monica|you okay
ross|yah because phoebe knew the mugger
monica|how do you know a mugger
phoebe|i'm sorry i have friends outside the six of us
ross|you wanna know how she knew him
ross|because phoebe used to mug people
monica|seriously
phoebe|well i'm not proud of it but you know… sometimes when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff i…
monica|phoebe that is awful
phoebe|well ok i wasn't rich like you guys ok i didn't eat gold and have a flying pony… i had a hard life my mother was killed by a drug dealer…
monica|you're mother killed herself
phoebe|she was a drug dealer
ross|well anyway it was a good thing phoebe knew the knew him because i was about to do some serious damage
phoebe|okay…
monica|well this must've brought back some really bad memories for you ross
phoebe|why
monica|well ross was mugged as a kid
phoebe|you were
ross|yeah it was pretty traumatic
ross|i was outside st
ross|marc's comics… you know i i i was just there minding my own business you know seeing what kinda trouble got into that week 
monica|wonderwoman
ross|anyway i was heading towards this bakery you know to pick up a couple of dozen linzer torts for someone… … when outta nowhere this with a pipe jumps out and says gimme your money punk
ross| 
phoebe|oh my god…
ross|i know
ross|and and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork i had done for my own comic book science boy 
monica|oh yeah
monica|what was his superpower again
ross|a superhuman thirst for knowledge
monica|that's it
ross|well i i better get to class are there any more of your friends i should look out for on my way phoebe
phoebe|no… actually you might wanna stay away from jane street… that's where stabby joe works
phoebe|okay i think we have a problem here
monica|what
phoebe|well uhm back in my mugging days you know i uhm i worked st
phoebe|marc's comics
monica|yeah

other| geology rocks
other| 
monica|oh my god
phoebe|i know… i mugged ross

other|look at that still in character i like it… i plant seeds i can't explain
monica|hey
chandler|hey
monica|what are you doing
chandler|putting on the sneakers… thought i'd get into a younger mindset you know to see if it sparked anything…
rachel|oh anything yet
chandler|yes how's this they're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet
joey|hey
joey|probably wanna know what i'm doing…
monica|no that seems about right
joey|yesterday at my audition i really had to pee and apparently having to pee makes me a really good actor
joey|i got a call back so i'm drinking everything
joey|oh by the way that egg nog in our fridge was great
rachel|joey that was formula
joey|we gotta get more of that
chandler|you know what… these aren't half bad
chandler|you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren
rachel|okay first of all that's stupid and second of all i'm not allowed to talk to ralph
chandler|alright i feel younger already
chandler|yah i think i broke my hip
phoebe|hey you
ross|hey
phoebe|hey how was class
ross|no one ever asked me that what's wrong
phoebe|nothing i really wanna know
ross|oh… well uhm there was actually a rather lively discussion about the pleistocene…
phoebe|alright nothing is worth this
phoebe|uhm i have a confession to make… uhm okay you know that girl that mugged you when you were a kid…
ross|wh what are you talking about
ross|it wasn't a girl
ross|it was this huge dude
phoebe|you don't have to lie anymore ross i know that it was a fourteen year old girl
ross|no it wasn't
phoebe|yes it was
ross|no it wasn't
ross|you don't think i would've defended myself against a fourteen year old…
phoebe| gimme your money punk
phoebe| 
ross|oh my god it was you
ross|i can't believe it you… you mugged me
phoebe|yeah and i'm so so sorry ross i'm sorry but you know if you think about it it's kinda neat
phoebe|i mean well it's just that i i've always felt kinda like an outsider you know the rest of you have these connections that go way back and you know now you and i have… have a great one
ross|it's not the best
phoebe|i know i'm sorry please forgive me
phoebe|i don't know what to say…
ross|there's nothing you can say
ross|that was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me
phoebe|really
phoebe|even more humiliating than…
ross|hey let's not do this
other|… and then at the end of the commercial the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other
other|that's interesting
other|just one thought you didn't mention the shoes
other|who's next
other|chander…
chandler|okay… you start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes
chandler|he's about my age…
other|your age
chandler|a huh
chandler|so he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself
chandler|just then a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes
chandler|he jumps over the old guy and laughs and the line reads not suitable for adults
chandler| 
other|chandler that's great
chandler|oh thank you sir… or man who's two years younger than me
other|you see
other|that has a clear selling point
other|it appeals to our key demographic it's…
other|you did you come up with that
chandler|i don't know i don' i don' know
chandler|i was just trying to get into a young mindset you know and it just started to flow
other|that is great
other|good work
other|see all of you tomorrow
chandler|the cold weather hurts my hip
phoebe|hey ross
phoebe|i know you're still mad at me but can i just talk to you for a second
ross|sure go ahead
ross|whoops sorry sure go ahead
phoebe|i just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something i think you'll find very exciting
ross|oh my god crap from the street
phoebe|look ross in this box are all the things i got from mugging that i thought were too special to sell… or smoke
phoebe|anyway i was looking through it and i found science boy 
ross|oh my god
ross|i never thought i'd see this again
ross|it's all here
ross|what made you save it all these years
phoebe|i can't say i just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day
ross|you really thought science boy was worth saving
phoebe|yeah… but you should know i also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here
