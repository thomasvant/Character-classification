joey|maybe you could take charlie shopping
rachel|oh well
other|i'm sure you have better things to do
joey|are you kidding
joey|rachel loves to shop
joey|and she has great taste
joey|yeah she's the one who taught me you don't wear white after labour day and that you always always always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes
other|if you have the time i'd really appreciate the help
rachel|ok uh uh
rachel|let's let's shop
joey|ok you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes
joey|and some slutty lingerie slutty
phoebe|ok great

phoebe|that's off right
joey|what's the matter pheebs
phoebe|oh
phoebe|mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight he's gonna be there
phoebe|and she was like oh don't worry
phoebe|i asked him
phoebe|he's totally ok with seeing you
phoebe| 
phoebe|so now i have to go so he'll think that i'm totally ok with seeing him
rachel|which you're not because you've totally hung up on him
phoebe|exactly
rachel|and you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous
phoebe|i didn't even think about that
phoebe|aaargh sexual politics
rachel|hey pheebs i'm i'm taking charlie shopping why don't you come and i'll help you find something
phoebe|ok that'll be great
joey|oh ain't that nice
joey|the three of you trying on slutty lingerie together
rachel|that's not what we're gonna do
joey|why would you ruin it who was that hurtin'
chandler|wow
chandler|fortunately she has a very pretty face
monica|oh i so can't believe this
monica|my uterus is an inhospitable environment
monica|i was trying so hard to be a good hostess
chandler|oh i can't believe my sperm have low motility because let me tell you when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places
other|hi there
chandler|hi
monica|hi
other|i'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but i wanted to talk to you about your options
monica|ok
other|above all even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great you never know
other|so keep having s x on a regular basis
chandler|oh damn it
monica|don't worry after a while he'll tune it out
other|ok given your situation the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy or insemination using a sperm donor
monica|ok
other|and of course if you feel that neither of those is right for you you can always adopt
chandler|is that a hint
chandler|because we love you doctor connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child
chandler|wow talking about an inhospitable environment
rachel|hi
rachel|ok you're ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping
other|oh yeah
other|let's do it
joey|alright have a good time
rachel|not gonna find any clothes in there
ross|hey you guys
rachel|hi
ross|guess who's up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference
other|umh
other|kurts baley
ross|yeah right
ross|what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract well why are you laughing
joey|just
joey|seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist
joey|it's fun yeah
other|so you're up for keynote speaker
other|who's making the decisions
ross|professor sherman yeah
ross|i've a meeting with him today
other|he's a pretty tough guy to impress
ross|yeah well
ross|i think i know how to dazzle him
rachel|oh
rachel|you're not gonna do a magic trick are ya
ross|tsz
ross|no
chandler|hey guys
ross|wait a minute you guys
ross|oh i wanna ask you something
ross|i i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do i'd love for you guys to come and hear me
chandler|i think i can safely say that we all have family issues work stuff and or are sick
ross|it's in barbados
chandler|but you come first
rachel|i'm there
other|we'll see you guys
joey|bye
rachel|bye see ya
chandler|ok
joey|all right so
joey|how did it go at the fertility clinic
chandler|not as much fun as last time
chandler|apparently you only get p0rn if you're giving a sperm sample
ross|so so what did the doctor say
chandler|well
chandler|there's surrogacy but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child she has felt that watching a surrogate would be
chandler|too hard for her
joey|so you're ruling out surrogacy
chandler|yeah
joey|so i don't have to learn what that means
chandler|aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination so
chandler|we're talking about sperm donors
joey|enough said i'm there for you man
joey|where is she upstairs
chandler|ah ha
ross|how do you feel about all this
chandler|i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i don't think there is one
joey|come on ross be a good guy
joey|step up and do it
ross|what
ross|what
ross|no
ross|i am not going to give them ben
ross|the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are are staggering
other|mmm mm
ross|i mean we've been accepting leakey's dates as a given but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can you can just throw most of our assumptions you know right in the trash
ross|so so what i am saying is is is that is that the repercussions could be huge
ross|i mean not just in palaeontology but if if you think about it in evolutionary biology uh genetics geology uh i mean truly the mind boggles
ross|oh that's not what you want
other|incentive for men
phoebe|oh i'll take some of that
rachel|pheebs that's for men
phoebe|no i know this way when i go to the party later mike will know i am over him cause i'm gonna smell like another guy
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|ok
phoebe|oh good i'm dating a russian cab driver
phoebe|seriously does anyone buy this
phoebe|i smell like beets
other|so you know what i really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them

rachel|ok
rachel|it's just when i see them together sometimes i just get a little jealous
phoebe|uh wow
phoebe|isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him
rachel|oh i get it
phoebe|oh well as long as it is under control you know you can't do anything about it he's already dating her and she is a nice person that wouldn't be right
rachel|i know i know so it is just not a big deal

chandler|i mean if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy get to check him out
monica|chandler
chandler|i'm telling you he's great
chandler|i mean even if my sperm worked fine i'd think he'd be the way to go
