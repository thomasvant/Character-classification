phoebe|and she was like oh do not worry
phoebe|i asked him
phoebe|he is totally ok with seeing you
phoebe|so now i have to go so he will think that totally ok with seeing him
rachel|which you are not because you have totally hung up on him
phoebe|exactly
rachel|and you are gonna want him to eat his heart out so you are gonna have to look fabulous
phoebe|i did not even think about that
phoebe|aaargh sexual politics
rachel|hey pheebs taking charlie shopping why do not you come and help you find something

chandler|wow
chandler|fortunately she has a very pretty face
monica|oh i so cannot believe this
monica|my uterus is an inhospitable environment
monica|i was trying so hard to be a good hostess
chandler|oh i cannot believe my sperm have low motility because let me tell you when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places
other|hi there
chandler|hi
monica|hi
other|sorry there was not better news from your test last week but i wanted to talk to you about your options
monica|ok
other|above all even though your chances of conceiving through natural means are not great you never know
other|so keep having s x on a regular basis
chandler|oh damn it
monica|do not worry after a while he will tune it out
other|ok given your situation the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy or insemination using a sperm donor
monica|ok
other|and of course if you feel that neither of those is right for you you can always adopt
chandler|is that a hint
chandler|because we love you doctor connelly but we do not think we had want you to be our child
chandler|wow talking about an inhospitable environment
rachel|hi
rachel|ok you are ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping
other|oh yeah
other|let us do it
joey|alright have a good time
rachel|not gonna find any clothes in there
ross|hey you guys
rachel|hi
ross|guess who is up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference
other|umh
other|kurts baley
ross|yeah right
ross|what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract well why are you laughing
joey|just
joey|seeing what it had be like to be a paleontologist
joey|it is fun yeah
other|so you are up for keynote speaker
other|who is making the decisions
ross|professor sherman yeah
ross|a meeting with him today
other|he is a pretty tough guy to impress
ross|yeah well
ross|i think i know how to dazzle him
rachel|oh
rachel|you are not gonna do a magic trick are ya
ross|tsz
ross|no
chandler|hey guys
ross|wait a minute you guys
ross|oh i wanna ask you something
ross|i i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do love for you guys to come and hear me
chandler|i think i can safely say that we all have family issues work stuff and or are sick
ross|it is in barbados
chandler|but you come first
rachel|there
other|we will see you guys
joey|bye
rachel|bye see ya
chandler|ok
joey|all right so
joey|how did it go at the fertility clinic
chandler|not as much fun as last time
chandler|apparently you only get p0rn if you are giving a sperm sample
ross|so so what did the doctor say
chandler|well
chandler|there is surrogacy but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child she has felt that watching a surrogate would be
chandler|too hard for her
joey|so you are ruling out surrogacy
chandler|yeah
joey|so i do not have to learn what that means
chandler|aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination so
chandler|we are talking about sperm donors
joey|enough said there for you man
joey|where is she upstairs
chandler|ah ha
ross|how do you feel about all this
chandler|i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i do not think there is one
joey|come on ross be a good guy
joey|step up and do it
ross|what
ross|what
ross|no
ross|i am not going to give them ben
ross|the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are are staggering
other|mmm mm
ross|i mean we have been accepting leakeys dates as a given but if they are off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can you can just throw most of our assumptions you know right in the trash
ross|so so what i am saying is is is that is that the repercussions could be huge
ross|i mean not just in palaeontology but if if you think about it in evolutionary biology uh genetics geology uh i mean truly the mind boggles
ross|oh that is not what you want
other|incentive for men
phoebe|oh take some of that
rachel|pheebs that is for men
phoebe|no i know this way when i go to the party later mike will know i am over him cause gonna smell like another guy
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|ok
