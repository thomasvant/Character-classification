monica|what you guys don't understand is for us kissing is as important as any part of it
joey|yeah right
joey|y'serious
phoebe|oh yeah
rachel|everything you need to know is in that first kiss
monica|absolutely
chandler|yeah i think for us kissing is pretty much like an opening act y'know
chandler|i mean it's like the stand up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out
ross|yeah and and it's not that we don't like the comedian it's that that
ross|that's not why we bought the ticket
chandler|the problem is though after the concert's over no matter how great the show was you girls are always looking for the comedian again y'know
chandler|i mean we're in the car we're fighting traffic
chandler|basically just trying to stay awake
rachel|yeah well word of advice bring back the comedian
rachel|otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home listening to that album alone
joey|are we still talking about s x
ross|no it's good it is good it's just that mm doesn't she seem a little angry
other|well she has issues
ross|does she
other|he's out banging other women over the head with a club while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet
ross|marsha these are cave people
ross|okay
ross|they have issues like 'gee that glacier's getting kinda close
ross|' see

joey|yeah sorry the swallowing slowed me down
monica|whose little ball of paper is this
chandler|oh uh that would be mine
chandler|see i wrote a note to myself and then i realised i didn't need it so i balled it up and

phoebe|she's already fluffed that pillow
phoebe|monica you know you've already fluffed that but it's fine
monica|look i'm sorry guys i just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have
chandler|yes and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow

phoebe|and not not in a good way
joey|yeah calm down
joey|you don't see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come

other|don't listen to your mother
other|you're independent and you always have been
other|even when you were a kid
