chandler|i mean it is like the stand up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out
ross|yeah and and it is not that we do not like the comedian it is that that
ross|that is not why we bought the ticket
chandler|the problem is though after the concerts over no matter how great the show was you girls are always looking for the comedian again yknow
chandler|i mean we are in the car we are fighting traffic
chandler|basically just trying to stay awake
rachel|yeah well word of advice bring back the comedian
