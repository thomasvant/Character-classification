chandler|now that one card could be worth 100 bringing your total to 1 500
chandler|don’t get to excited because that’s not gonna happen unless you get no way
monica|well this is the last box of your clothes
monica|i’m just gonna label it what were you thinking

rachel|like what monica
monica|y’know she has 147 000 pairs of boots
rachel|oh yeah good start mon
monica|she lets you borrow them
rachel|yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet
monica|do you wanna live outside
monica|because it’s gettin’ cold
monica|she gets tons of catalogs and umm she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that i’d like
phoebe|what else
monica|when i take a shower she leaves me little notes on the mirror
rachel|yeah i do
rachel|i i do do that
phoebe|that’s nice
phoebe|i like having things to read in the bathroom
monica|when i fall asleep on the couch after reading she covers me over with a blanket
