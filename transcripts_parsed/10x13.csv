chandler|yeah i've been to these places before but i've never really seen them you know
monica|yeah you miss alot when you're moo ing
other|thanks so much for showing me around
monica|oh
monica|it was our pleasure
monica|we are so much enjoying getting to know you
other|well if there is anything else you wanna know
chandler|oh uhm okay uhm do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father
other|oh sure
other|yeah well he was my high school boyfriend
other|captain of the football team really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college
chandler|that's great
other|yeah
other|it's almost definitely him
monica|how's that now
other|well there is a chance it's another guy
other|i mean i have only ever been with two guys but they sorta overlapped
chandler|so what does the other guy do
chandler|does he go to college too
other|no he's in prison
monica|was he falsely accused of something
other|no
other|he killed his father with a shovel
other|but other than that he's a great guy
chandler|i'll bet his dad doesn't think so
monica|are you awake
chandler|of course i'm awake
chandler|assume from now on that i'm always awake
monica|alright we don't know that it's him
monica|i mean it could be the football guy
chandler|honey it's us
chandler|of course it's the shovel killer
monica|alright lets say that it is him would we not want the baby
monica|no
monica|would we treat him any differently
chandler|i'd keep an eye on him
chandler|we have to find out which one the father is
monica|how
chandler|i dunno aren't there tests for these things right
monica|yeah but maybe we're just over reacting
chandler|pff easy for you to say he's a father killer
chandler|he probably loves him mommy
chandler|he's probably got a tattoo that says mom on his shovel wielding arm
other|we will now count from one to five
other|un deux trois quatre cinq
joey|huh un blu bla flu flenk
other|good job
joey|thank you
phoebe|hey joey

rachel|in the future when a girl asks for some ill advised sympathy s x
rachel|just do it
ross|wait wait you're mad at me about last night
ross|i was just trying to do the right thing
rachel|really
rachel|well it seems to me if you'd done the right thing i would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed i would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied
ross|well
rachel|oh stop that
ross|i can't believe this
ross|i was just being a good guy
ross|i treated you with respect and understanding
rachel|oh that is so hot
rachel|she walks around him to the other side 
ross|hey i was looking out for you
rachel|oh really well ross you know what
rachel|i am a big girl
rachel|i don't need someone telling me what is best for me
ross|i gotta say i have not had s x a lot of times before this is the worst ever
rachel|oh really really
rachel|well it wasn't very good for me either
ross|hey you know what
ross|you know what
ross|to avoid this little thing in the future let's just say you and me never having s x again
rachel|what
ross|that's right s x is off the table
ross|i am never having s x with you again
ross|dr
ross|green are you feeling better
chandler|hey
chandler|how was lunch
other|we had a good time

other|no
other|you we're right that was fun
other|i'm gonna go finish packing
chandler|o okay

monica|nope she doesn't have to i found out who the father is
chandler|oh god
chandler|it's shovely joe isn't it
monica|no it's not
chandler|how do you know
other|well it turns out that erica didn't pay much attention in s x ed class because the thing she did with that prison guy
other|it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way

chandler|the thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do
monica|the thing we never do
