monica|it was our pleasure
monica|we are so much enjoying getting to know you
other|well if there is anything else you wanna know
chandler|oh uhm okay uhm do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father
other|oh sure
other|yeah well he was my high school boyfriend
other|captain of the football team really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college
chandler|that is great
other|yeah
other|it is almost definitely him
monica|how is that now
other|well there is a chance it is another guy
other|i mean i have only ever been with two guys but they sorta overlapped
chandler|so what does the other guy do
chandler|does he go to college too
other|no he is in prison
monica|was he falsely accused of something
other|no
other|he killed his father with a shovel
other|but other than that he is a great guy
chandler|bet his dad does not think so
monica|are you awake
chandler|of course awake
chandler|assume from now on that always awake
monica|alright we do not know that it is him
monica|i mean it could be the football guy
chandler|honey it is us
chandler|of course it is the shovel killer
monica|alright lets say that it is him would we not want the baby
monica|no
monica|would we treat him any differently
chandler|keep an eye on him
chandler|we have to find out which one the father is
monica|how
chandler|i dunno are not there tests for these things right
monica|yeah but maybe we are just over reacting
chandler|pff easy for you to say he is a father killer
chandler|he probably loves him mommy
chandler|he is probably got a tattoo that says mom on his shovel wielding arm
other|we will now count from one to five
other|un deux trois quatre cinq
