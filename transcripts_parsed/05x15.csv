phoebe|i i'll be honest with you guys when i first met ross i didn't like him at all
phoebe|but then once i got to know him i saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous
phoebe|i mean all i'm saying is don't judge ross before you get to know him all right
phoebe|i mean i like all you guys now but when i first meet you y'know kurt i thought y'know abrasive drunk umm lola mind numbingly stupid
phoebe|and okay you guys gold digger cradle robbing perv
phoebe|so i think you all know what i mean
phoebe|obviously i didn't think they were gonna start throwing things

chandler|sorry is pretty much fourth y'know behind being ready and actually wanting to get married
chandler|will you be my wife
monica|chandler umm i want you to take just a minute and i want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds
chandler|yeah i'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now
monica|honey
monica|do you know that none of that stuff came from me
monica|i mean i never said i wanted to have babies and get married right now
chandler|yeah i know but i was really confused and then i talked to these guys
monica|who
monica|two divorces and joey
ross|hey
joey|she's right y'know
ross|yeah but still cheap shot
monica|y'know what
monica|y'know when i said that i want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own
monica|well you're not ready for that
chandler|i didn't think i was
monica|oh my god what would have done if i said yes
chandler|well i would've been happy because i would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that i love
chandler|or you would've seen a chandler shaped hole in that door

rachel|oh no wait pheebs i think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you
rachel|but i'm not sure chandler
chandler|okay how long is this going to go on
monica|well i think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so a long time
ross|this is fun

ross| well i'm sorry will you marry me
chandler|that's not funny
joey|that's not funny at all
