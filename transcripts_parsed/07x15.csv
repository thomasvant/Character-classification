ross|sorry i’m kinda keeping this one on the q
ross|t
chandler|well whatever it is i hope it involves winking
joey|hey
joey|so i just talked to one of the dool writers today and
monica|what is dool
joey|days of our lives
joey|anyway you’re not gonna believe it
joey|my character is coming out of his coma
chandler|that’s great
joey|and and and not only that i’m gettin’ a new brain
chandler|so great things are happening at work and in your personal life
rachel|wait what do you mean you’re getting a new brain
joey|oh well they’re killing off one of the characters on the show and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body
ross|what
ross|a brain transplant
joey|yes it’s a highly controversial procedure
ross|it’s ridiculous
joey|well i think it’s ridiculous that you haven’t had s x in three and a half months
ross|it’s winter they are fewer people on the street
monica|who are they killing off
joey|uh cecilia monroe she plays jessica lockhart
other|noo
monica|she’s my favorite character on dool
joey|nice
rachel|she is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces i mean i don’t think i’ve ever seen her finish a beverage
monica|and the way she slaps all the time
rachel|oh
monica|wouldn’t you love to do it just once
chandler|don’t do it
rachel|cecilia monroe man what a great actress
joey|oh tell me about it
joey|and she’s been on the show forever it’s gonna be really hard to fill her shoes
ross|yeah yeah help me out here when you come out of the brain transplant you are going to be her
joey|yes but in drake ramoray’s body
joey|why is this so hard for you to get
joey|i thought you were a scientist
phoebe|rach so that guy there
phoebe|straight or gay
rachel|well have to say gay
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|why
rachel|well mainly because he is kissing that other guy
phoebe|oh no not that guy there
phoebe|that guy right there
rachel|oh yeah he is too cute to be straight
phoebe|ohh knockers will help us figure it out
rachel|all right straight and not subtle
phoebe|ohh he left his cell phone
rachel|oh well we can hand it to gunther and he will put it in lost and found
phoebe|or we could use it to call china
phoebe|see how those guys are doing
rachel|what if um if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and i answer and we start talking and we fall in love
rachel|i mean would not that be a great story
rachel|kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age
phoebe|yeah that does sound great
phoebe|going to get the phone
rachel|what
rachel|wait
rachel|why why do you get the story
phoebe|i do not know
phoebe|i have not been out on a date in so long
rachel|phoebe you had a date three days ago
phoebe|that wasn’t a date
phoebe|that was that was just friends getting together having s x
rachel|okay
rachel|okay see
rachel|i get the phone
phoebe|no way
phoebe|no way
phoebe|you just broke with tag a week ago
rachel|yeah
rachel|and until now i didn’t think i’d love again
phoebe|nice try
rachel|oh hey hey wait
rachel|how do we fairly decide who gets the phone
phoebe|i don’t know
rachel|well umm maybe we could uhh ah ha
rachel|too slow
phoebe|ah ha
phoebe|too cocky
other|i’m going to keep dating him mother and there’s nothing you can do about it
other|oh yes there is
other|what are you going to do
other|kill him
other|like you did with charles
other|that was an accident
other|and so were you
other|well at least i’m not a murderer
other|oh my baby
other|cut
joey|that was a great scene
joey|and and and that slap looks so real
joey|how do you do that
other|oh just years of experience
other|can i get some ice here
joey|oh anyway i just wanted to say how wonderful i think you are
other|you’re not the fan who’s dying are you
joey|say what
other|i’m supposed to meet and hug a fan who is dying but that’s not supposed to be until later
joey|no
joey|no i’m joey tribbiani we did a scene together yesterday
joey|i i’m the guy in the coma
other|oh that was a real person
joey|an an anyway i i just wanted to say that since i’m getting your brain when you leave the show i was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
other|i i i’m leaving the show
joey|i don’t know
joey|why
joey|did you hear something
other|who told you that
joey|oh uh one of the writers
other|which one
other|was it bald or was it tall
joey|umm
other|y’know what
other|it doesn’t matter
other|because it is not true
joey|okay
other|and if it were true how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that i’ve been playing for 20 years i’ll give you a tip
joey|ms
joey|monroe oh there you go
rachel|no phoebe
rachel|you cannot get the phone that way that’s not fair
rachel|okay look i have an idea
rachel|why don’t we why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him
rachel|and then whoever does gets the phone
phoebe|or we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone
rachel|i don’t think so
phoebe|fine all right but i’d bet you’d be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet
rachel|all right first name on the speed dial is mom
phoebe|ohh i lost my mom to suicide
rachel|okay no way you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin
phoebe|did i use that already today
phoebe|i’m sorry
rachel|yes okay
rachel|well now see this isn’t telling us anything

other|they don’t know exactly when it’s going to happen but apparently it is going to be very soon and that’s it
joey|i’m so sorry
joey|look if it was up to me you would never leave the show
other|yeah thanks
joey|no i mean it
joey|i can’t believe they would do this to you
joey|and to your fans
joey|i mean they are going to be devastated
joey|heart broken
joey|they love you so much
other|oh you’re right
other|thank you
other|what’s your name again
joey|joey
other|joey well thank you
other|that is so sweet
other|oh excuse me
other|it wasn’t my decision
other|i’m having a conversation here
other|you were saying
joey|uh yeah ye ye ye ye ye l l l l l look the the the only reason that i that i came up to you before was because well i’m really nervous about about being you
joey|y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character
joey|y’know
joey|help me keep jessica alive
joey|please
other|all right joey i will help you
other|not because i i owe it to this stupid show but because i owe it to jessica
joey|oh that’s great
joey|oh thank you so much
other|you’re so welcome
joey|hey
joey|now i’ve been watching some tapes how’s this
joey|jessica lockhart will never set foot in this place again
joey|ever
other|is that supposed to be me
joey|yeah
other|yeah but jessica doesn’t have an english accent
joey|i can do an english accent
joey|that baby’s going on my résumé
chandler|well i feel like a snack
monica|do you want some shortbread
monica|eh that’s scottish like you are
chandler|oh no thanks
chandler|i don’t like anything from my scottish heritage
ross|what
chandler|well it’s just my entire family was run out of scotland by vikings
chandler|anyway lots of bad memories
ross|oh well it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh rediscover its scottish roots
monica|no
monica|no no they’re not
monica|they’re still very angry
monica|but y’know chandler is also half swedish
monica|you know what the swedish people are famous for
monica|sitting down and being quiet
ross|well yeah yeah the scottish history is so much more
monica|you can not play bagpipes at the wedding
ross|how did you know about that
chandler|we heard you play all the way from your apartment
ross|were you the ones called the cops
chandler|that’s not really important right now
chandler|what is important is while we appreciate the gesture we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding
ross|why not
chandler|because we hate them
ross|come on that’s not fair
ross|i mean you haven’t even heard me play
chandler|we have heard you play
ross|no you’ve heard my practice
ross|okay
ross|just just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want
ross|and i’m not going to tell you what song i’m gonna play either
ross|but uh let’s just say when it’s over i’ll bet there will be a wee bit o’ celebration
other|so the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence
other|so when jessica enters a room for instance she owns everything and every person in that room
other|you try
joey|okay
joey|all right
other|no he already knows that he owns everything in the room
other|he’s not finding it out for the first time
other|so try it again
joey|okay
joey|okay
other|right
other|he’s not angry at the room either
other|try it again he owns it
other|he owns the room
other|it is his
other|he owns owns owns owns the room
other|he owns it
other|all right it’s a little weird but it’s getting better
other|oh well i’m gonna miss this woman so much
other|i don’t know what i’m going to do
other|i mean it’s been 20 years of my life
joey|oh well hey hey
joey|maybe maybe uh maybe this is a good thing
joey|y’know
joey|it’ll it’ll give you a chance to shake things up play different characters
joey|you’re so talented
other|i am
other|i am but i don’t know you know
other|an actor of a certain age is not that easy
joey|hey that’s not true
joey|look at uh look at angela lansb angelina jolie
other|i probably should’ve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in but y’know i just got so comfy here
other|and ohh i turned down some amazing work
joey|like like what
other|well let’s just say if i left 15 years ago the landscape of mexican cinema would be very different today
joey|wow
other|but well now now’s a different time for me
joey|oh hey come on don’t don’t don’t do this
joey|umm look let let me tell you something okay
joey|now when i watch you do a scene i’m thinking boy she she is a great actress
joey|uh but but i am also thinking she is hot
other|you think i’m hot
joey|you own the room
joey|we should probably get get uh
other|oh yeah yeah we should get the so when jessica kisses a man she usually puts umm both her hands on the man’s face
joey|yeah yeah i noticed that
joey|is that ‘cause she’s so passionate
other|no
other|it’s because that way the camera only sees her
other|do you wanna try it
joey|yeah
