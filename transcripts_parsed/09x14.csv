ross|hey i hope emma isn't making it too hard on you
joey|no hey it's been great
ross|yeah
joey|yeah
joey|and look i just want you to know that with rachel staying here and everything all my feelings from before are totally over okay

phoebe|thanks
phoebe|so how is it living with rachel again
phoebe|i mean apart from the great food
joey|i'm fine i'm fine it's just it's just weird what's happening with her and ross
joey|you know yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody
phoebe|oh my god rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too
joey|why are they doing this
phoebe|i don't know
phoebe|they're so perfect for each other it's crazy
joey|you know what's crazy
joey|these jars
joey|what is it like two bites in here
phoebe|i just wish they'd realise they should be together
joey|i know i know
joey|and when they moved back in together i figured y'know that's where things were headed
phoebe|i know
phoebe|they should be a family
phoebe|they should get married and have more children
joey|yes and they should name one of their kids joey
joey|i may not have kids someone's gotta carry on the family name
phoebe|you know what
phoebe|maybe once they start dating and they see what's out there they'll realise how good they are for each other
joey|yeah because it is slim pickings
joey|i had this date last night yuck
joey|but we should probably keep it down she's still in the bedroom
phoebe|so what are we gonna do
phoebe|are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people
joey|i know that just pushes them further and further apart
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|oh i know what we can do
phoebe|we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates so that they'll realise how good they are together
joey|ooh that's a great plan
phoebe|yeah you know what the best part of it is
phoebe|i get to do my plan laugh
phoebe|

joey|can't you get on top for once
chandler|all right all right we were
chandler|we were trying to make a baby
chandler|monica's ovulating
joey|hey
joey|it is unacceptable that you two would have s x with emma in the next room
joey|i'm gonna have to tell rachel about this
chandler|no no no
monica|no please don't
monica|please joey
monica|she will kill us
joey|hey i gotta

rachel|oh well i
rachel|it's kind of weird talking to you about this but
ross|monica told me you had a blind date
rachel|yeah
ross|i did too
rachel|oh
ross|but is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up
rachel|oh oh no
rachel|do you think she walked in saw you and left
ross|why does everyone keep saying that
rachel|well if it makes you feel any better i wish my date hadn't shown up
ross|that bad
rachel|well he makes t shirts for a living and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this
ross|female body inspector
ross|what size is that
phoebe|now wait a minute
phoebe|so they're gonna name their first child joey
joey|uh huh
phoebe|how how do i get them to name the next one after me

phoebe|oh so they owe me like three phoebes
phoebe|oh my god
phoebe|look it's ross and rachel
phoebe|oh the plan is working
phoebe|don't don't do the plan laugh
ross|the first date we've had in months and they were both such disasters
rachel|oh
rachel|huh
rachel|you know it is weird that phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you up on a date that didn't even show
ross|wait a minute you don't think it was intentional
ross|i mean that's just stupid
joey|we're geniuses

phoebe|oh yeah they're falling in love all over again
phoebe|oh they see us
phoebe|oh they they look mad
phoebe|oh they figured it out

other|what
joey|we've been stood up
joey|and we want our free crab cakes
other|guys give it a rest
other|nobody's betting on you tonight
other|although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry
other|i have such fat hands
