chandler|i'd like to propose a toast
chandler|little toast here ding ding
chandler|i know this isn't the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned but for me this has been really great you know i think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting
chandler|anyway i was just thinking i mean if you'd gone to vail and if you guys'd been with your family if you didn't have syphilis and stuff we wouldn't be all together you know
chandler|so i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked
