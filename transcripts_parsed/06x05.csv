chandler|when you’re done over there we kinda have a situation over here too
phoebe|na uh no we are all responsible for our own babies
chandler|see that’s where i think that you’re wrong
chandler|we’ve been playing these babies man for man we should really be playing a zone defense
monica|what do you mean
chandler|i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone
chandler|phoebe you can be in charge of wiping
chandler|and y’know mon you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around…
phoebe|that sounds really great but maybe you should be in charge of wiping
chandler|okay i’m a rookie
chandler|i should not be in the end zone
monica|this is so great
monica|this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant
phoebe|yeah
phoebe|well this is not what i ordered
joey|hey guys
chandler|hey
phoebe|hey
joey|hey babies
joey|oh i’m having the best morning
joey|that uh that porsche i’ve got the keys too still there
chandler|shocking
chandler|since you still have the keys
joey|you should see the treatment i get when i’m with that car
joey|people are friendly they they wanna talk and not just about the car
joey|one guy gave me advice about my equity investments
chandler|what equity investments
joey|the ones that got me the porsche
joey|will you keep up
joey|but i figured if if people keep seeing me just standing there they’re gonna start to think that i don’t own it
joey|so i figured i’ll wash it
joey|right
joey|monica you got a bucket and some soap i can borrow
monica|oh yeah i got soap and sponges and rags and carnuba wax and polishing compound
chandler|you don’t even have a car
monica|i know
monica|but umm one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building so i washed it
chandler|and
monica|and six others
chandler|there you are
joey|yeah she tops out at 130
other|wow
joey|and that’s just in the city
joey|i get her up to 160 when i take her upstate
other|really
other|you got a place upstate
joey|sure
other|well i’ll see you later
joey|okay take it easy
other|hey
other|that’s my car
joey|really
joey|oh uh oh just give me five more minutes with it
other|what what are you doing
joey|oh i i uh found the keys and now i’m just polishing her up
other|but it’s my car
joey|yeah but it’s my wax
other|listen i i i don’t come to this city much so i don’t know if you’re crazy or this is some kind of street theater but could i have my keys
joey|sure
joey|here
joey|i’ll uh save your parking spot
other|i’m not coming back
joey|why not
other|i live upstate
joey|yeah so did i
phoebe|i don’t know why i was so nervous about this
phoebe|and i don’t know why frank and alice are always complaining
phoebe|this is so easy
monica|yeah two hours a lifetime that’s the same
chandler|check it out
chandler|check it out
chandler|when the babies wake up they can meet krog
monica|chandler what are you doing
monica|that thing can put someone’s eye out
chandler|he can do more than that
chandler|he can destroy the universe
phoebe|no chandler they can swallow one of those little parts
phoebe|and also look at his smooth area that’s just gonna mess them up
chandler|they’re not gonna swallow anything you guys are being way over protective
chandler|when i was a kid my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass
phoebe|what
chandler|glass sand whatever
phoebe|oh look at little leslie stretching in her sleep
monica|oh it’s so cute
monica|i wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head
phoebe|oh i can still do that
monica|how are you still single
chandler|all right
chandler|i thought about it and maybe you’re right
chandler|maybe krog is not a safe toy
monica|good
monica|what made you change your mind
chandler|i swallowed the sonic blaster gun
phoebe|how did that happen
chandler|well i was trying to prove that i was right
chandler|y’know
chandler|and it turns out i was wrong
chandler|and now it’s lodged in my throat
monica|damnit
monica|y’know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and and no one was watching chandler
other|okay you two are asking the court for an annulment
rachel|yes your honor and here are are forms all filled out
other|so based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that mr
other|geller is mentally unstable
ross|fine i’m mentally unstable
other|and based on the fact that mr
other|geller is intravenous drug user
ross|what
rachel|uh yes heroin and crack
ross|crack isn’t even an intravenous drug
rachel|well you would know
other|now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage
ross|oh come on
rachel|ross please i found the magazines
other|and finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage
other|well that makes sense since you’re gay and addicted to heroin
ross|okay i’m sorry this is insane
ross|i i i’m not addicted to heroin i’m not gay and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything
ross|look i’ll consummate this marriage right here right now
other|that won’t be necessary
ross|and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies
rachel|ugh
other|now if you were two involved in a serious relationship that really creates a problem
rachel|ross
rachel|your honor rest assured relationship ended like two years ago
rachel|and could you strike consummated like bunnies from the record
other|is there anything in this record that is actually true
rachel|well yes we got married in vegas and uh and the names i think
other|well based on what i heard you two certainly don’t qualify for an annulment
other|if you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce
ross|that’s great
ross|are you happy now
ross|look what you did with your funny funny form
rachel|what
rachel|me
rachel|what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense
ross|and what what are you typing that for
ross|did you hear what she said
ross|we don’t get the annulment
ross|don’t type that
ross|what
ross|stop typing
ross|hey
ross|stop typing
ross|stop typing
ross|stop typing
rachel|okay do you see do you see what you’re keeping me married too
other|you need to get out of my chambers
rachel|all right look lady here is the deal i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one
ross|yeah
other|would you like to spend the night in jail
rachel|and thank you for your time
joey|so the porsche guy took his car back
chandler|but you found the keys to his clothes
joey|no
joey|no i just uh i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche
monica|and people will think you own a porsche because you’re wearing the clothes
joey|of course
joey|only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car
joey|right
chandler|that is true
phoebe|yeah but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun
joey|oh i’ve been there
joey|yeah i am gonna go drive my porsche
monica|joey you know you don’t actually have one
joey|come on
joey|what are you doing
joey|i’m in character
joey|would you talk to her
chandler|ahh i think it just moved
chandler|it’s really poking me
monica|all right that’s it we’re going to the emergency room
phoebe|what
phoebe|no you can’t you can’t leave me here with them
phoebe|we’re baby sitting
monica|the babies are asleep i’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for a while
phoebe|but you you can’t leave me with them
phoebe|we we’re a team
phoebe|we’re playing a zone
phoebe|they’re gonna triple team me
monica|he’s got something plastic lodged in his throat we’ve got to go to the hospital
phoebe|but no because a doctor won’t be able to help him it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years
chandler|i think that’s gum
phoebe|i’m pretty sure it’s gun
chandler|okay listen this really hurts
chandler|let’s go
phoebe|a real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital
phoebe|no
phoebe|what would what would krog do
joey|why isn’t that valet back with my porsche
other|maybe because you’ve got the keys
joey|porsche
rachel|this is totally your fault
ross|my fault
ross|you threatened the judge
rachel|well you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine
ross|that was the only way i could get him to stop typing
joey|hi
joey|how are the gellers
rachel|don’t call us that
ross|the judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment
ross|now we gotta get a divorce
ross|did a porsch throw up on you

phoebe|well it’ll dry
phoebe|okay you sit with your brother and sister now who aren’t there
chandler|hey
phoebe|how do you feel
chandler|well let’s just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours
phoebe|okay so i totally took care of the babies all by myself
phoebe|i fed ‘em bathed ‘em and put ‘em to bed
chandler|and protected them from a tornado
monica|oh my god
phoebe|i know the babies are asleep
monica|phoebe what what happened here
phoebe|i did it
phoebe|i took care of the babies all by myself
monica|but my apartment
chandler|was the setting of phoebe’s triumph
monica|but the mess
chandler|is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself
monica|you’re right you’re right i shouldn’t freak out
monica|‘cause this is what will happen when you and i have babies
monica|when will that be
chandler|phoebe would you take a look at this mess
rachel|oh honey thank god you’re home i was getting worried
ross|i picked up the divorce papers
ross|uh i’ve already signed everything and i put little ‘x’s where you need to sign
rachel|oh little ‘x’s
rachel|great
rachel|that makes up for everything
ross|y’know i i you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too
ross|okay
rachel|oh name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one
ross|okay how about you flew to london to stop my wedding
ross|ah how about you told me you loved me after i was already married
rachel|hey
rachel|wait a minute
rachel|that was different
rachel|i did those things because i was in love with you
ross|yeah
ross|right
ross|you’re right
ross|that’s very different
ross|so let’s let’s just sign the papers
ross|all right
ross|what
rachel|nothing
ross|okay can we just sign please
rachel|uh hmm
ross|congratulations
rachel|okay ross we’re wait a minute
rachel|umm i uh i kinda have a little confession
ross|what
rachel|well y’know this whole marriage thing kinda my idea
ross|excuse me
rachel|well remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married
ross|yeah
rachel|and uh yeah i didn’t really i didn’t want to say anything but it kinda it just it kinda kept coming back to me and umm remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes
rachel|and uh and i thought it would be funnier if we got married
rachel|so as a as a compromise we decided first to get married and then to eat a lot of grapes
rachel|so umm sorry i got us into this mess
ross|so then if if i mean if you think about it this is all your fault
rachel|yeah don’t push it though
ross|i’ve got to say i know i divorce a lot of women never thought i would be divorcing you
rachel|i know
rachel|i always thought if you and i got married it would be the one that stuck
rachel|and it wouldn’t be a secret and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at pizza hut
ross|did i did i even treat
rachel|no it was on the house it was it was a newlywed special
ross|that may be the most depressing thing i’ve heard in my life
ross|i should probably get these to my lawyer’s office
rachel|hey thanks ross for taking care of all of this
ross|eh no problem
rachel|i’m gonna need a copy of those
ross|totally
