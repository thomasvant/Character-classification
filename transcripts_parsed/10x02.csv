chandler|we have to leave
monica|why
monica|what did you do in the bathroom
chandler|i didn't get to the bathroom
chandler|i bumped into owen on the way and he didn't know he was adopted
chandler|and there's a slight chance i may have told him
monica|oh my god where's my purse
monica|no you know what
monica|i can replace everything in there
monica|get that binder and let's go
other|hey
other|some little snacks for everybody
other|oh you don't have to eat the sour worms
other|those are for owen
other|i'll go get him in a second
other|by the way you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet
chandler|but kids are so intuitive
chandler|don't you think on some level he already knows
other|i'm adopted
chandler|see
chandler|intuitive
other|what
other|where did you hear that
other|he told me
other|and he paid me 50 dollars not to tell
chandler|which technically now you should give back
other|you told him he's adopted
chandler|i'm so sorry but you should have a sign out there or something
chandler|or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door
chandler| owen doesn't know he's adopted and he also thinks that santa is real
chandler| 
other|he isn't
other|we have to get out of here baby
