ross|big shot is better than ‘wethead’
joey|okay some tricks of the trade
joey|now i’ve never been able to cry as an actor so if i’m in a scene where i have to cry i cut a hole in my pocket take a pair of tweezers and just start pulling
joey|or ah or let’s say i wanna convey that i’ve just done something evil
joey|that would be the basic ‘i have a fishhook in my eyebrow and i like it’ okay let’s say i’ve just gotten bad news well all i do there is try and divide 232 by 13
joey|and that’s how it’s done
joey|great soap opera acting tonight everybody class dismissed
