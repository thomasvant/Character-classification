ross|why would i eat my own arm
chandler|well you wouldn't but we own the paper we can print whatever we want
monica|you know what ross

joey|seriously that's your fantasy
joey|to invest it
ross|oh i'm sorry did i say invest it 
ross|i meant be cool and piss it all away 
joey|ooh ooh i know
joey|we should pool all own money and buy the knicks
rachel|i don't really care about the knicks
joey|oh you will when i pick you as starting forward
rachel|you would do that
rachel|i never get picked
chandler|you know i'm not sure a sports team is the way to go
joey|you're not gonna let me buy the knicks
joey|i can't believe you're taking this away from me
chandler|you're right it has been you dream for over 15 seconds
ross|uh how long until they announce the numbers mommy
chandler|i'll take this one too uh
chandler|mommy
ross|oh i've gotten into the habit of calling rachel mommy when we're around emma
ross|which i now realize we are not
rachel|i'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word
ross|although if we're gonna do that we should probably call me daddy too
phoebe|oooh i like that daddy 
ross|i
ross|i was just talking about rachel
phoebe|oooh is daddy getting angry
phoebe|is daddy gonna spank me
ross|well that depends
ross|have you been a baaad gi

chandler|he's the boss's son
monica|come on lottery
rachel|ooh you guys it starts in like 20 minutes
monica|ok here we go
monica|we need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won
monica|so does anybody have any ideas how to organize this
monica|ok how about this we divide them into 6 groups of 40 and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first
rachel|ooh i have another idea
monica|i'm sorry idea time is over
phoebe|ok well are all the tickets in the bowl
monica|yeah
chandler|what about the ones you have on the nightstand
monica|there are no tickets on the nightstand
chandler|yes there are i just saw them a few minutes ago
monica|un no you didn't
monica|you must be mistaken
chandler|honey there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand
monica|chandler sense the tone
rachel|well well well look what mommy found
monica|ok fine
monica|i bought 20 extra tickets for me and chandler
phoebe|uh
phoebe|the psychic also said that i would be betrayed
ross|i can't believe this i thought we were all in this together
monica|hey you just got in 5 minutes ago
ross|3 minutes ago
ross|i don't know why that's important
joey|i was with you the whole time we were in connecticut when did you even get those
monica|when you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic
joey|i'll show you how
rachel|ok well monica suppose one of your special tickets win
rachel|how are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends
monica|please
monica|if i win the lottery you guys are not gonna leave me
monica|someone gave me a basket of mini muffins last week and i couldn't get rid of you for 3 days
rachel|chandler would you just tell her what she did was wrong
chandler|she's right you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us
monica|ahhh
chandler|let me finish
chandler|however it doesn't look like i'm gonna get this job so i can't afford to have principles so screw you the tickets are ours
monica|there's the man i married
rachel|all right believe me
rachel|if you win the lottery it's the last you're gonna hear from us
monica|fine
monica|don't be my friends
monica|i'll buy new friends
monica|yeah and then i'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you
rachel|oh
rachel|alright you know what
rachel|that's it
rachel|i want my share of the tickets
joey|yeah i want my tickets too
joey|and i'm buying the knicks
joey|and steffi graff ah ah
ross|than i want mine too
ross|and if i win i'm gonna put it all into a very low yield bond
phoebe|oh you guys
phoebe|we've got to keep all the tickets together
monica|no no
monica|we should divide them up and i should get extra because we used my card to buy them
joey|hey if anybody gets extra tickets it should be me
joey|this all thing was my idea
chandler|oh yeah
chandler|thanks for inventing the lottery
rachel|ok that's it
rachel|just give'em to me
rachel|i'll split them up
joey|oh
phoebe|ooooohhhhh

phoebe|fine i can't take it anymore
phoebe|i'm putting an end to this
rachel|oh if she jumps i get her tickets
joey|no no
phoebe|if we are not doing it together we're not doing it at all
phoebe|so say goodbye to your tickets
