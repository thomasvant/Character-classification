phoebe|that’s why you won’t go out with her again
phoebe|so she took some fries big deal
joey|hey hey look
joey|it’s not about a few fries

joey|hey hey hey hey
joey|look
joey|i take a girl out she can order whatever she wants

rachel|what
phoebe|joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries

phoebe|you wouldn’t let her have a grape
rachel|oh no
rachel|not me
rachel|emma
joey|joey doesn’t share food
phoebe|well i still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again
phoebe|you are calling her
phoebe|and if you need to just get an extra plate of fries for the table
joey|i like that
joey|a sharing buffer
joey|yeah
joey|i’ll order some extra fries
joey|maybe a plate of onion rings
joey|yeah
joey|and a shrimp cocktail
joey|and some buffalo wings
joey|maybe an individual pizza uh

rachel|i’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you
ross|really
rachel|yes
rachel|and i know what looks sexy on guys
rachel|please just wear what i suggest and she’s gonna go nuts for you
ross|so you’re saying uh if i wear these pants i might be getting into hers
rachel|why do men keep talking to me like this
chandler|so the fact that i am a doctor and my wife’s a reverend that’s important to you
other|yeah i read some great applications but then i thought “who better then a minister to raise a child
other|”
monica|amen
chandler|plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor
monica|uh good hands
monica|healing hands
other|reverend can i ask
other|does the bible say anything about adoption
monica|it says “do it
monica|”
monica|and behold she did adopt onto them a baby
monica|and it was good
other|wow
chandler|yeah wow
other|i was wondering you both have such serious jobs
other|would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock
monica|oh you know my flock is good i mean yeah my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point
monica|good flock
monica|flock flock flock
other|being a doctor must take up a lot of time
chandler|no ot for me it doesn’t
other|so how’s everything going in here
other|we’re great i think i may have asked all my questions
other|do you have any question for erica
chandler|yeah actually
chandler|so you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us
other|yes our system assures total anonimity
other|we’re very proud of it
chandler|you should be
chandler|you’re really on top of stuff
other|well then if there’s nothing else then the two of us should talk
other|actually i don’t think we have to
monica|we don’t
other|yeah when i read about you two i was pretty sure i wanted you but i just thought we should meet face to face
other|made my decision
other|i choose them
monica|oh my god this is great
monica|this is so great
monica|did you hear that
chandler|yeah i did
monica|hey thank you
monica|thank you so much
monica|you are so going to heaven
rachel|we got some really great stuff

phoebe|oh
phoebe|okay
phoebe|wait are we in joeys imagination
rachel|oh no
rachel|i took one of ross bags bymistake and one of mine is missing

ross|yeah
ross|rachel picked it out for me
ross|she told me to trust her and you know what
ross|glad i did
ross|i turned quite a few heads on my way over here
joey|dude i really do not think you should be wearing that
ross|oh i see somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies
joey|looks like someone is the ladies
ross|you are just jealous because you could not pull this off
ross|yeah now if you will excuse me i have a date
ross|see
ross|all eyes on me
chandler|we are not signing those papers
monica|why not
chandler|it is wrong
chandler|they made a mistake
chandler|they think we are somebody else
monica|god works in mysterious ways
chandler|you have gotta stop
monica|but she liked us
chandler|she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica
monica|well if you think about it i am kind of like a reverend
monica|i mean as a chef i serve god by feeing the hungry and poor
chandler|your veal chop is 34 95
monica|cmon chandler i think we have been given an opportunity
monica|i mean the mistake has already been made
monica|they are writing up the paper right now
chandler|but we are not the one she chose
chandler|how can you feel okay about this
monica|because
monica|we may not be who she thinks we are but no one will ever love that baby more than us
chandler|i know
monica|i mean who knows how long it is gonna take for someone else to give us a baby
monica|what if what if no one ever picks us
