chandler|that's what our friends call us
other|gosh you know you're just such an amazing couple
other|it's
other|kind of intimidating
monica|i don't know about that
other|you're kidding me
other|i mean it's enough that you are a doctor
other|but on top of it you're married to a reverend
chandler|i don't think that's exactly
monica|let her finish doctor
phoebe|hey
joey|hey
phoebe|oh my friend sarah had a great time last night

joey|you know what your great friend did
joey|we're out to dinner ok
joey|we're getting along having a really nice time
joey|i was thinking she was really cool
joey|and then out of nowhere
phoebe|that’s it
phoebe|that’s why you won’t go out with her again
phoebe|so she took some fries big deal
joey|hey hey look
joey|it’s not about a few fries
joey|it’s about what the fries represent
phoebe|what
joey|all food
phoebe|i’m sorry i can’t believe i set you up with such a monster
joey|hey hey hey hey
joey|look
joey|i take a girl out she can order whatever she wants
joey|the more the better
joey|all right
joey|just don’t order a garden salad and then eat my food
joey|that’s a good way to lose some fingers
phoebe|oh
rachel|hi
phoebe|thank god you’re here
phoebe|listen to this
rachel|what
phoebe|joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries
rachel|oh
rachel|oh no
phoebe|what
phoebe|you know about the plate thing
rachel|oh yeah
rachel|joey doesn’t share food
rachel|i mean just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and
phoebe|you wouldn’t let her have a grape
rachel|oh no
rachel|not me
rachel|emma
joey|joey doesn’t share food
phoebe|well i still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again
phoebe|you are calling her
phoebe|and if you need to just get an extra plate of fries for the table
joey|i like that
joey|a sharing buffer
joey|yeah
joey|i’ll order some extra fries
joey|maybe a plate of onion rings
joey|yeah
joey|and a shrimp cocktail
joey|and some buffalo wings
joey|maybe an individual pizza uh
joey|and some mozzarella sticks
joey|what were we talking about
phoebe|this place is awesome
ross|you know we should just go i’m not gonna find anything here
ross|this stuff is ridiculous
rachel|ah this place is great
phoebe|wow
ross|rach come on i’m not gonna wear any of this
ross|nothing silver
ross|ok
ross|nothing with hair
ross|and nothing with padlocks on it
rachel|ross look i know that some of this stuff is out there but i mean come on look at this look at this sweater
rachel|i mean this is just beautiful
ross|wow this is really soft
ross|three hundred and fifty dollars
rachel|yeah down from seven hundred you are saving like two hundred bucks
ross|both logic and math are taking a serious hit today
other|hey check this out
other|it’s totally you
ross|wow
phoebe|yeah
ross|actually this looks like pretty good
ross|yeah
ross|boys will be boys
phoebe|what
phoebe|they will be
ross|all right that’s it i’m getting out of here
rachel|no no no no
rachel|ross wait
rachel|come on
rachel|you know there’s other stuff
rachel|here’s a nice shirt look at these nice pants
ross|uh actually these might look pretty good on me
rachel|yes they will
rachel|you know what you should do
rachel|just go take a walk all right
rachel|i know your size and i’m
rachel|i’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you
ross|really
rachel|yes
rachel|and i know what looks sexy on guys
rachel|please just wear what i suggest and she’s gonna go nuts for you
ross|so you’re saying uh if i wear these pants i might be getting into hers
rachel|why do men keep talking to me like this
chandler|so the fact that i am a doctor and my wife’s a reverend that’s important to you
other|yeah i read some great applications but then i thought “who better then a minister to raise a child
other|”
monica|amen
chandler|plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor
monica|uh good hands
monica|healing hands
other|reverend can i ask
other|does the bible say anything about adoption
monica|it says “do it
monica|”
monica|and behold she did adopt onto them a baby
monica|and it was good
other|wow
chandler|yeah wow
other|i was wondering you both have such serious jobs
other|would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock
monica|oh you know my flock is good i mean yeah my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point
monica|good flock
monica|flock flock flock
other|being a doctor must take up a lot of time
chandler|no ot for me it doesn’t
other|so how’s everything going in here
other|we’re great i think i may have asked all my questions
other|do you have any question for erica
chandler|yeah actually
chandler|so you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us
other|yes our system assures total anonimity
other|we’re very proud of it
chandler|you should be
chandler|you’re really on top of stuff
other|well then if there’s nothing else then the two of us should talk
other|actually i don’t think we have to
monica|we don’t
other|yeah when i read about you two i was pretty sure i wanted you but i just thought we should meet face to face
other|i've made my decision
other|i choose them
monica|oh my god this is great
monica|this is so great
monica|did you hear that
chandler|yeah i did
monica|hey thank you
monica|thank you so much
monica|you are so going to heaven
rachel|we got some really great stuff
phoebe|yeah yeah but i am not sure about some of the bra's i got
rachel|oh
rachel|really
rachel|do you wanna try some of them on for me
phoebe|oh
phoebe|okay
phoebe|wait are we in joey's imagination
rachel|oh no
rachel|i took one of ross' bags bymistake and one of mine is missing
phoebe|oh well ross probably has it you can get it from him later
ross|so
ross|what do you think
joey|i think were not wearing the same shirt anymore
ross|yeah
ross|yeah
ross|rachel picked it out for me
ross|she told me to trust her and you know what
ross|i'm glad i did
ross|i turned quite a few heads on my way over here
joey|dude i really don't think you should be wearing that
ross|oh i see somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies
joey|looks like someone is the ladies
ross|you're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off
ross|yeah now if you'll excuse me i have a date
ross|see
ross|all eyes on me
chandler|we are not signing those papers
monica|why not
chandler|it's wrong
chandler|they made a mistake
chandler|they think we're somebody else
monica|god works in mysterious ways
chandler|you have gotta stop
monica|but she liked us
chandler|she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica
monica|well if you think about it i am kind of like a reverend
monica|i mean as a chef i serve god by feeing the hungry and poor
chandler|your veal chop is 34 95
monica|c'mon chandler i think we have been given an opportunity
monica|i mean the mistake has already been made
monica|they are writing up the paper right now
chandler|but we are not the one she chose
chandler|how can you feel okay about this
monica|because
monica|we may not be who she thinks we are but no one will ever love that baby more than us
chandler|i know
monica|i mean who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby
monica|what if what if no one ever picks us
chandler|oh honey
monica|please
monica|please we are so close
chandler|monica i want a baby too but this woman is giving away her child
chandler|she deserves to know who it's going to
monica|okay right
chandler|so we'll tell the truth and who knows maybe she'll like us for us
monica|maybe she will
monica|uh

monica|look doctor
other|i don't understand
chandler|the agency must have made some mistake
chandler|my wife is not a reverend and i'm not a doctor

other|i'll go check your file
other|excuse me
other|so who are you
chandler|well our names really are monica and chandler
chandler|we're from new york
monica|yeah but the important thing to know about us is how much we would care for this little baby
other|so you lied to me before
monica|well we
monica| bore false witness 
monica|see i could be a reverend
other|i can't believe this
monica|but we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider
other|giving you my baby
other|you think i'd give you my child after this
monica|well you don't have to decide right now but if you could just look at our file
other|i don't want to look at your file
other|this is over
chandler|erica wait
other|i've nothing to say to you
chandler|you have every reason to be upset
chandler|we did lie
chandler|but only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long
chandler|now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again
other|why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it
chandler|erica please
