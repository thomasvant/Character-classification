phoebe|whatever
phoebe|what about you meg
other|well i don’t care about the divorces either but i wouldn’t date him

monica|yeah she didn’t cry
monica|she wasn’t angry or sad
chandler|and you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry
monica|i mean all i’m asking for is just a little emotion
monica|is that too much to ask after six years
monica|i mean what
monica|are are are rachel and i not as close as you guys
monica|i mean do we not have as much fun
monica|don’t i deserve a few tears
monica|i mean we we told joey he cried his eyes out
joey|hey
joey|i did not cry my eyes out
joey|come on
joey|it’s like the end of an era
joey|no more j man and channie’s
chandler|okay i gotta ask who calls us that
other|you got married again
ross|yes
other|so that’s your second marriage in two years
ross|yes second in two years
ross|third overall
other|ross i have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had i so much business from one client
other|why don’t you tell me what happened
ross|basically rachel and i were in vegas and we got drunk
other|i’m sorry is this the same rachel who’s name you said at the altar in the second marriage
ross|yes yes yes
ross|but i i do not love her
other|oh that’s better then
ross|this was just a drunken mistake and i need to get it annulled
other|i see
other|have you considered therapy
ross|i think just the annulment for today
other|there are a couple of forms to fill out
ross|easy
other|and we’ll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh sound mind
ross|no problem
other|and we’ll need you and rachel to testify before a judge
ross|ooh
ross|there’s no way to do this without her
ross|‘cause i kinda all ready told her uh it was it was already taken care of
other|of course you did
other|look ross you can’t get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there
ross|uh ha what about someone who looks like rachel
ross|i will think about the therapy
rachel|hey
monica|hey
monica|so um i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff
rachel|okay
monica|y’know no point in dragging it out
monica|dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore
rachel|okay
monica|hey rach what about this
monica|huh
monica|who who gets this
monica|see i don’t know if i want it because it might be y’know too many memories
rachel|what the hell is that
monica|i don’t know
monica|hey rachel you want the big plate
monica|i want you to have the big plate
rachel|wow
rachel|mon thanks
rachel|i love this plate
monica|something to remember me by
rachel|mon honey you’re not dying
rachel|i’m just moving out
rachel|y’know i mean we’re gonna see each other all the time
monica|but still it’s a big change
monica|the end of an era you might say
rachel|are you okay
rachel|you’re not blinking
monica|i’m fine
monica|i just i’m thinking how much it’s an end of era
rachel|oh all right
rachel|but y’know i gotta say i don’t i don’t think six years counts as an era
monica|an era is defined as a significant period of time
monica|now it was significant to me maybe it wasn’t significant to you
rachel|what is the matter with you
monica|what is the matter with you
monica|why aren’t you more upset
monica|aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore
monica|i mean aren’t you gonna miss me at all
rachel|all right fine but don’t get mad at me
rachel|it’s it’s just a little hard to believe
monica|what’s hard to believe
rachel|well y’know it’s you guys
rachel|you you do this kind of stuff
rachel|y’know
rachel|i mean you you were gonna get married in vegas and then you backed out
rachel|i guess i’m not upset because i don’t see you guys going through with it
rachel|i’m sorry
monica|rachel it’s going to happen
monica|chandler is gonna move in here
rachel|but i
monica|no no wait
