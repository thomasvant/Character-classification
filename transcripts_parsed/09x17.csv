ross|nobody called nobody wrote anything nobody cares that dead
ross|oh my god
ross|nobody cares that dead
chandler|no come on you know that is not true
ross|what are you talking about
ross|you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet
ross|i did not get one response
ross|and dead
chandler|well the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community
ross|i cannot believe this
ross|not even my geology lab partner
ross|and i carried that guy
chandler|alright look let us think about this ok do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time
chandler|that people are gonna post condolences on a website
chandler|this is not about people not caring that you are dead
chandler|this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief
ross|you are right
ross|there is not a decent outlet
chandler|right i mean come on sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service tons of people would come
ross|exactly
chandler|ross what are you

rachel|oh god
joey|she is being unreasonable
rachel|joey there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much oh do not cover its ears
