joey|this isn't over
monica|alright wait a second why would ross tell everyone in your class that you are as
monica| gay as the day is long 
chandler|because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs

ross|unbelievable my classmates are gonna think i'm dead my professors my
ross|my parents are gonna get phone calls

chandler|you should have heard how hurt professor stern was yesterday when i told him i wouldn't be able to go with him to key west
ross|you've really crossed the line here but that's okay it's ok 'cause i'm on my way to buy some photoshop software and a stack of gay p0rn
ross|that's right
ross|your coming out is about to get real graphic
phoebe|god i wish mike were here
monica|okay if mike were here what would the two of you be doing
monica|what are you animals
monica|it's 4 o'clock in the afternoon
phoebe|i gotta call him
phoebe|just to talk to him there's no harm in that
monica|phoebe that's how it starts
monica|i don't need to eat the cake i'll just smell the icing
monica|why don't i just eat a little sliver or okay just a slice or two
monica|and next thing you know you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide
monica|phoebe honey i know this is hard

joey|but he's the same
rachel|joey come on
joey|he's the same
joey|you're not the same

other|look if i wanna see phoebe and she wants to see
monica|this doesn't concern you
other|oh
other|sorry i guess i was thrown off by the mention of my name
monica|look guys you can't do this it's just going to make getting over each other that much harder
phoebe|not if nothing happens
phoebe|why can't
phoebe|why can't we just hang out as friends
monica|sure
monica|if you're just gonna hang out as friends then maybe i'll join ya
monica|you know i'm your friend and mike's friend

other|i've missed you
phoebe|i've missed you too
monica|you know on the way over here i saw this drunk guy throw up
monica|and then a pigeon ate it
chandler|hey ross i just wanted to apologize
chandler|don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me
ross|uhu uhu check this out
chandler|huh
chandler|so that's what i would look like if i worked out
chandler|and was being serviced by a policeman
chandler|you're not actually going to send these out are ya
ross|eh
ross|actually no i don't need to because your little ross is dead joke didn't work ok there were no responses
ross|nobody posted anything on the website nobody called my parents so the joke my friend is on you
ross|nobody called nobody wrote anything nobody cares that i'm dead
ross|oh my god
ross|nobody cares that i'm dead
chandler|no come on you know that's not true
ross|what are you talking about
ross|you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet
ross|i didn't get one response
ross|and i'm dead
chandler|well the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community
ross|i can't believe this
ross|not even my geology lab partner
ross|and i carried that guy
chandler|alright look let's think about this ok do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time
chandler|that people are gonna post condolences on a website
chandler|this is not about people not caring that you're dead
chandler|this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief
ross|you're right
ross|there isn't a decent outlet
chandler|right i mean come on i'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service tons of people would come
ross|exactly
chandler|ross what're you
chandler|what're you
chandler|what are you doing
chandler|you're having a memorial service for yourself
ross|no
ross|that would be stupid
ross|you're having it for me
chandler|ross don't press send don't press se
ross|oh too late too late
ross|it's sent
ross|oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man
rachel|i'm trying to put emma down for a nap have you seen hugsy
joey|original or crappy
rachel|original
joey|no sorry haven't seen him
rachel|then what's that big lump under your covers
joey|it's monica ok
rachel|that's not monica
joey|alright
joey|fine
joey|it's original hugsy
joey|no now i know that emma wants him but he's mine and i need him
rachel|oh god
joey|she's being unreasonable
rachel|joey there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much oh don't cover its ears
rachel|it's because it reminds her of her uncle joey
joey|it does
rachel|yeah
rachel|and she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much
joey|really
joey|she
joey|she loves me
rachel|oh yeah
rachel|but you know what
rachel|if you need hugsy don't worry
rachel|emma will totally understand
rachel|i won't
rachel|but whatever
joey|ok wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute i mean rach i mean if if
joey|if hugsy means that much to emma then
joey|well she can have him

monica|here's a few things you can discuss mucus fungus and the idea of me and ross doing it
other|i've missed you so much
other|no i'm not gonna ask you to get back together because i know we want different things but just to be with you one more night
phoebe|i know i want that too but is that going to make it too hard
other|it can't be any harder than this

chandler|i didn't know ross and you were so close
other|we weren't but we had one class together
other|he was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science
other|i always remembered him
chandler|i'm sure that would mean a lot to him
chandler|and if heaven has a door i'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently
other|i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out
other|i guess i really missed my chance
ross|but you didn't
ross|i'm still alive
ross|kori i know this is a big surprise for you
ross|it's a long story but the things you just said really made my day
ross|i mean the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people
other|you sick freak who does that
other|i can't believe i had a crush on you
ross|did you hear that
ross|kori weston had a crush on me
ross|no mum i'm not dead
