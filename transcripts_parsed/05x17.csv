rachel|ah first i i would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again
other|that is quite all right but i feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped
rachel|okay
rachel|umm well first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh for yelling at you
other|fair enough
rachel|now you are probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah who did who did not umm yell at you and storm out and i think that is a big mistake and heres why
rachel|i made a huge fool of myself and i came back that shows courage
rachel|when i thought you wanted s x in exchange for this job i said no
rachel|that shows integrity
rachel|and i was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage
rachel|okay umm now i know i already said courage but yknow you gotta have courage
rachel|and umm and finally when i thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace i said no and i was not litigious
rachel|by the way litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against
rachel|so she did not want to sue him
rachel|do not worry i had to look it up too
rachel|so there you go you got you got courage you got integrity you got courage again and not litigious
rachel|look mr
other|zelner
