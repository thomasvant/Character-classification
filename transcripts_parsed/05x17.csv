joey|yeah yeah that's her
joey|but y'know what

monica|why
joey|because it's impossible to find her apartment
joey|she lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe or something
monica|what are you talking about
monica|she obviously lives on the second floor seventh apartment from the left
joey|no
joey|no
joey|no
joey|she lives on the third floor eighth apartment from the left
monica|no those first two windows that's the lobby

ross|sure
ross|joey…
joey|dahhhhh
joey|no
joey|noooo
rachel|ah first i i would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again
other|that's quite all right but i feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped
rachel|okay
rachel|umm well first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh for yelling at you
other|fair enough
rachel|now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah who did who did not umm yell at you and storm out and i think that's a big mistake and here's why
rachel|i made a huge fool of myself and i came back that shows courage
rachel|when i thought you wanted s x in exchange for this job i said no
rachel|that shows integrity
rachel|and i was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage
rachel|okay umm now i know i already said courage but y'know you gotta have courage
rachel|and umm and finally when i thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace i said no and i was not litigious
rachel| by the way litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against
rachel|so she didn't want to sue him
rachel|don't worry i had to look it up too
rachel| so there you go you got you got courage you got integrity you got courage again and not litigious
rachel|look mr…
other|zelner
rachel|zelner
rachel|right
rachel|i knew that
rachel|i really really want this job and i think i think i would be really good at it
other|y'know what
other|i may regret this but uh i'm going to give you a shot
rachel|oh
rachel|you are
other|um hmm
rachel|really
rachel|oh thank you
rachel|oh… oh would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug
other|yes
rachel|okay well then how about a handshake

chandler|oh yeah it's so cool
chandler|now i gotta go officer bing has gotta 10 100
chandler|that's pee pee
monica|phoebe you have a a twig in your hair
phoebe|ohh umm we kinda took a little detour on the way over here
other|yeah we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around so…
monica|you didn't
phoebe|we did
phoebe|we violated section 12 paragraph 7 of the criminal code
monica|the park huh
monica|a public place
other|uh huh
monica|i hear ya
monica|excuse me for just a second
monica|hi chandler
chandler|monica
chandler|this is the men's room
chandler|isn't it
monica|yes it is
monica|you see i've always found the men's bathroom very sexual
monica|haven't you
chandler|no
chandler|and if i did i don't think we'd be going out
chandler|monica this is getting ridiculous
monica|come on we can't let them win
chandler|ugh we have already proved that we are hot
chandler|okay
chandler|so why why are you getting so obsessed about this thing
monica|because phoebe and gary are in that can't keep their hands off each other doing it in the park phase
chandler|so
monica|i feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore
chandler|oh wow
chandler|is that what this all have been about
monica|wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time
chandler|yeah that was great
chandler|that was really great
chandler|but to tell you the truth i'm more excited about where we are right now
monica|really
chandler|yeah
chandler|i've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before
chandler|y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time i think that's pretty incredible
chandler|and the fact that this is happening all with you yeah i think that's pretty exciting
monica|that is so sweet
monica|i know that i was acting a little crazy but umm i feel the same way
chandler|yeah
monica|yeah
chandler|y'know what i just realized
chandler|you just freaked out about our relationship
monica|did not
chandler|yes you did
chandler|admit it
chandler|you freaked out
monica|okay i freaked out a little
chandler|little
chandler|you freaked out big time
chandler|okay
chandler|and i fixed it
chandler|we have switched places
chandler|i am the relationship and king and you are the crazy irrational screw up
