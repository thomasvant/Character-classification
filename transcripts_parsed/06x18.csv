rachel|who wrote it
ross|oh i wish i knew but the evaluations are all anonymous
joey|oh hey do you still have their final exams

chandler|a hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s rain man
rachel|okay wait a minute wait a minute why are we so sure that this is a girl
ross|it’s a girl

chandler|i see
ross|besides there’s a big age difference

ross|i know when i’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem like such a big difference
joey|no that’s not what i was going to say at all
