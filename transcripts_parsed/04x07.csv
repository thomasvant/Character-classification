chandler|i just walked in the bathroom and saw kathy naked
chandler|it was like torture
ross|y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured you’re in for a big surprise
chandler|it just keeps getting worse and worse
chandler|y'know
chandler|i mean it’s bad enough that i’m in love with my roommates girlfriend which by the way i think she knows
chandler|because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us
chandler|and call me crazy but i think she likes me too
chandler|and now i have seen her naked
chandler|i mean at least when i’ve seen her with clothes on i could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something
chandler|but there are no boles she’s smooth
chandler|smooth
phoebe|wow
phoebe|could everyone totally see up his robe
other|here you go
joey|great

chandler|wait
chandler|you’re going out with kathy
joey|yeah
joey|why are you getting so upset

chandler|i mean having s x with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you
joey|what is the big deal
joey|it’s not like we’re exclusive
chandler|look joey kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs
chandler|but casey i mean granted i only saw the back of her head but i got this sense that she’s she’s smart and funny and gets you
joey|you got all that from the back of her head
chandler|all right look i think it’s time for you to settle down

chandler|no
chandler|is there anyway anyway you think he’ll understand this
monica|you obviously haven’t screwed over a lot of your friends
monica|which we all appreciate

chandler|oh don’t say that
chandler|don’t say that
chandler|that’s not true
chandler|is it
phoebe|i think maybe yeah
monica|he loves you
chandler|then why didn’t you tell me to do that
