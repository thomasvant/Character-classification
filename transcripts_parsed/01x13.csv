monica|hey how long are you in the city
other|just for a coupla days
other|i got a job mid town
other|i figure i'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry
other|i don't know this one
phoebe|oh this is my friend roger
other|hi
other|hey hey
other|good to meet you roger
other|you too sir

joey|bazida and
joey|excuse me
joey|did you know this isn't ma
other|her name's ronni
other|she's a pet mortician
joey|sure
joey|so how long you been
other|remember when you were a little kid i used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships
joey|since then
other|no it's only been six years
other|i just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that i wasn't always such a terrible guy
other|joe
other|y'ever been in love
joey|i d'know
other|then y'haven't
other|you're burning your tomatoes
joey|you're one to talk
other|joe your dad's in love big time
other|and the worst part of it is it's with two different women
joey|oh man
joey|please tell me one of 'em is ma
other|of course course one of 'em's ma
other|what's the matter with you
joey|it's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life
joey|he's like actually some spy working for the cia
joey|that'd be cool
joey|this blows
rachel|i know i mean why can't parents just stay parents
rachel|why do they have to become people
rachel|why do they have
rachel|why can't you stop staring at my breasts
chandler|what
chandler|what
rachel|did you not get a good enough look the other day
ross|alright alright
ross|we're all adults here there's only one way to resolve this
ross|since you saw her boobies i think uh you're gonna have to show her your pee pee
chandler|y'know i don't see that happening
rachel|c'mon he's right
rachel|tit for tat
chandler|well i'm not showing you my 'tat'
monica|hello
phoebe|it's phoebe
other|and rog
monica|c'mon up
chandler|oh good
chandler|rog is here
joey|what's the matter with rog
ross|yeah
chandler|oh it's nothing it's a little thing
chandler|i hate that guy
ross|what so he was a little analytical
ross|that's what he does y'know
ross|c'mon he's not that bad
ross|y'see that's where you're wrong
ross|why would i marry her if i thought on any level that that she was a lesbian
other|i dunno
other|maybe you wanted your marriage to fail
ross|why
ross|why would i why
ross|why
ross|why
ross|why
other|i don't know
other|maybe maybe low self esteem maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling maybe you 
monica|waitwait go back to that sibling thing
other|well i don't know
other|i mean it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents
ross|that that's ridiculous
ross|i don't feel guilty for her failures
monica|oh
monica|so you think i'm a failure
phoebe|isn't he good
ross|nonono that that's not what i was saying
monica|y'know all these years i thought you were on my side
monica|but maybe what you were doing was sucking up to mom and dad so they'd keep liking you better
ross|hey i married a lesbian to make you look good
rachel|you're right
rachel|i mean you're right
rachel|it wasn't just the weebles but it was the weeble play palace and and the weebles' cruise ship
rachel|oh which had this little lifeboat for the weebles to wobble in

phoebe|me phoebe
other|well i'm not i'm not at all surprised they feel that way
phoebe|you're not
phoebe|see that's why you're so great
other|actually it's it's quite y'know typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic
other|y'know this kind of co dependant emotionally stunted sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which i'm sorry might as well have nipples on them and you're like all 'oh define me
other|define me
other|love me i need love
other|'
monica|so you talked to your dad huh
joey|yeah
joey|he's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does and my little sister tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order
joey|which has nothing to do with anything except that i found out today
rachel|wow
chandler|things sure have changed here on waltons mountain
ross|so joey you okay
joey|yeah i guess
joey|it's just parents after a certain point you gotta let go
joey|even if you know better you've gotta let them make their own mistakes
rachel|just think in a couple of years we get to turn into them
chandler|if i turn into my parents i'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty year old boys or
chandler|i'll end up like my mom
phoebe|hey
monica|how's it going
phoebe|oh okay except i broke up with roger
phoebe|yeah right
rachel|what happened
phoebe|i don't know i mean he's a good person and he can be really sweet and in some ways i think he is so right for me it's just
