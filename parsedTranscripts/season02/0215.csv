Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.  PHOEBE: I can be a waitress. OK watch this.

So, how ya been?  MONICA: I've been great, just great. How have you been?   DR. BURKE: Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.  MONICA: The head tilt?  DR. BURKE: Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt.  'How ya doin'? You OK?'  MONICA: I'm sorry.  DR. BURKE: No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob.  'I'm OK.'  'You sure?'  'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.  MONICA:  Oh, that's too bad.  DR. BURKE:  I'll survive.    CHANDLER: Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both.

You should ask him out.  MONICA: Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.  PHOEBE: So. You two are totally into each other.  MONICA: Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.  PHOEBE: OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?  MONICA: Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.  PHOEBE: Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?  MONICA: Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.    RACHEL: C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.  ROSS: I told you there was going to be sub-titles.  RACHEL: I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.    RACHEL: Monica.  ROSS: It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.

RACHEL: Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.  ROSS: I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.  RACHEL: OK.   ROSS: OK, my hands were no where near your butt.  RACHEL: I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.  ROSS: No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
