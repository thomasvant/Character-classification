Ross|Ross| Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah.
Ross|Ross| Yeah, what, what was I thinking?
Joey|Joey|  Hey! So, what’s with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Chandler|Chandler| Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Joey|Joey| Y’know what’s more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y’know what’s even more generous than that?!!
Chandler|Chandler| I see where you’re goin’!
Ross|Ross| What’s up with the greed Joe?
Joey|Joey| All right, look I’m sorry you guys, but it’s just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive, y’know? I’m down to like three! Well, actually two ‘cause one of ‘em I kinda blackened in some teeth—Why did I do that?! 
Ross|Ross| Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can’t-can’t you pick up, I don’t know, an extra shift here?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Or, y’know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you’ve got y’know a little of this  goin’ on. Wow! I still have it!
Ross|Ross| Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!
Joey|Joey| Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Chandler|Chandler|  Ah, finally an explanation.
Joey|Joey| No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let’s see uh, well I don’t want to donate sperm again.  I really prefer doing that at the home office y’know?  Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
Gunther|Other|  Joey!
Joey|Joey| Yeah?
Gunther|Other| What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you’re working?
Joey|Joey| Uhh do it?
Gunther|Other| That guy  has been waiting for his coffee for ten minutes! He’s complained about you three times! 
Joey|Joey| Well, where was I? 
Ross|Ross| Hi!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Hey!
Ross|Ross| Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
Ross|Ross| Wow!
Rachel|Rachel| Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
Joey|Joey| Takes it out of you? 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Now, we can kick anybody’s ass!
Rachel|Rachel| Yeah!
Ross|Ross| After one class? I don’t think so.
Rachel|Rachel| What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there  and pretend you’re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
Ross|Ross| Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that’s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s a concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call  unagi.
Rachel|Rachel| Isn’t that a kind of sushi?
Ross|Ross| No, it’s a concept!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel!
Ross|Ross| All right, maybe it means that too…
Rachel|Rachel| Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
Ross|Ross| Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care! 
Phoebe|Phoebe|  Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Ross|Ross| Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!
Phoebe|Phoebe| You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
Ross|Ross|  All I’m saying is, it’s one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I don’t know, like a  surprise!!
Ross|Ross| All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean you have unagi. 
Rachel|Rachel|  Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
Ross|Ross| Y’know what… 
Chandler|Chandler| Hey-hey, is Monica here?
Phoebe|Phoebe| No.
Ross|Ross| No.
Chandler|Chandler| Okay, look I need your help, I don’t know what to get her for Valentine’s Day.
Rachel|Rachel| Well, Valentine’s Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn’t get her a calendar!
Chandler|Chandler|  She was working on Valentine’s Day so we’re celebrating it tonight.
Joey|Joey| Ohh, hey! Why don’t you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Ooh, Joey, that’s actually a really good idea!
Joey|Joey| And of course, crotchless panties. 
Chandler|Chandler| Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend  and her brother,  I can’t do that we promised we’d make each other gifts this year.
Rachel|Rachel| Aw, I love that.
Phoebe|Phoebe| You guys!
Joey|Joey| You can’t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut…
Rachel|Rachel|  Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
Chandler|Chandler| I made a… 
Phoebe|Phoebe| What is that?
Chandler|Chandler| Nothing!
Ross|Ross| So what are you gonna do?
Chandler|Chandler| Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies!  Oh for crying out loud!
Rachel|Rachel| Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Now, it’s you little bunny friend. 
Chandler|Chandler|  This, this actually is a… 
Monica|Monica|  Hey!
Chandler|Chandler| Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Day gifts?
Monica|Monica| Oh, yeah.
Chandler|Chandler| Do we have to make the entire thing?
Monica|Monica| Yes! Why, did you—you forget to make yours?
Chandler|Chandler| Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
Monica|Monica| Okay.  Okay, I can’t wait! This is going to be the best Valentine’s Day ever!  I can’t believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
Chandler|Chandler|  What?
Monica|Monica| I’m just so excited to make the presents!  Shoot!
Joey|Joey|  Hi uh, I’m Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I’d like to donate some fluids.
Receptionist|Other| We’re actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we’re not looking for applicants right now.
Joey|Joey| Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in?
Receptionist|Other| Well, here’s a schedule of what’s coming up. 
Joey|Joey| Thanks.  Well but this one starts now. 
Receptionist|Other| Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It’s a twins study. 
Joey|Joey| But it’s $2,000.
Receptionist|Other| Sorry.
Joey|Joey| Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.
Receptionist|Other| We already got the results back on that on, and they’re not good. 
Ross|Ross| DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Ross!!!
Rachel|Rachel| What the hell was that?!
Ross|Ross| A lesson in the importance of unagi. 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Ohh, you’re a freak!!
Ross|Ross| Perhaps. Now I’m curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
Rachel|Rachel| All right, so we weren’t prepared!
Ross|Ross| I’m sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but I—look, I just want you guys to be safe.  DANGER!!!!!  Ahhh, huh? Unagi.
Joey|Joey|  2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? 
Chandler|Chandler| Hey.
Ross|Ross|  Chandler. I sensed it was you.
Chandler|Chandler| What?!
Ross|Ross| Unagi. I’m always aware.
Chandler|Chandler| Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?
Ross|Ross| What’s up?
Chandler|Chandler| I can’t figure out what to make Monica.
Ross|Ross| Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes.
Chandler|Chandler| I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
Ross|Ross| Y’know what? She’d-she’d love this.  Uh, it’s an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.
Ross|Ross| Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. 
Chandler|Chandler| Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her.
Ross|Ross| Why not?
Chandler|Chandler|" Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate Monica"" on the bottom."
Ross|Ross| Oh.
Phoebe|Phoebe| DANGER
Rachel|Rachel| DANGER
Rachel|Rachel| Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. 
Chandler|Chandler| Okay. Okay.  Yes honey, I made it myself.  I can’t do it. I can’t do it.  Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!! 
Chandler|Chandler| Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?
Monica|Monica| Sure! Okay, you go first.
Chandler|Chandler| Okay, come here! Come here.
Monica|Monica| Okay! 
Chandler|Chandler| Now, it’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it.
Monica|Monica| Okay.
Chandler|Chandler| But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
Monica|Monica| Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Chandler|Chandler|  Maybe we’ll have to listen and see!
Monica|Monica| Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Chandler|Chandler| Okay!
Monica|Monica| Okay, you ready to open yours?
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah!
Monica|Monica| Okay.
Chandler|Chandler| It’s a sock bunny.
Monica|Monica| Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
Chandler|Chandler| Not really.
Monica|Monica| Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that’s what this is about.
Chandler|Chandler| I see. Y’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
Monica|Monica| No! No, she doesn’t. Uh Phoebe, what she makes—that’s uh—they’re sock rabbits. They are completely different—Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn’t make it! I’m sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we’re supposed to make the presents!
Chandler|Chandler| Oh, it’s okay. I don’t…
Monica|Monica| No-no, it’s not okay! It’s not! I mean you were just… You’re so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y’know I’m just gonna—I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here , and I am going to do anything you want in there! 
Chandler|Chandler|  Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. 
Chandler|Chandler| Wow!  You are way to young to have seen that!
Monica|Monica| Oops!  Y’know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
Chandler|Chandler| You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
Monica|Monica| We have got to wash that! 
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah! 
Monica|Monica| Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
Chandler|Chandler| You have done enough!
Monica|Monica| I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
Chandler|Chandler| No you don’t—get it in black, not brown.
Monica|Monica| Oop, your cake is ready!
Chandler|Chandler| Oop!
Chandler|Chandler| Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.
Joey's Look-A-Like|Other| Hey Mon! Hey Chann!  Just gettin’ a soda!

Joey's Look-A-Like|Other| I’m Joey! How are you doin’?!
Joey|Joey|  No! No! No! No! No! How you doin’?! How you doin’—Damnit Carl! Go wait in the hall! 
Joey|Joey| Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Chandler|Chandler| Who the hell is Carl?!
Joey|Joey| Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Chandler|Chandler| Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren’t they?
Joey|Joey| Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y’know? The only problem is, Carl’s acting is… 
Monica|Monica| The only problem!
Joey|Joey| Yeah, he’s the reason I didn’t get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
Carl|Other|  Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
Joey|Joey|  Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Pat Sajak?

Phoebe|Phoebe| Alex Trebek?

Rachel|Rachel| Say it!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Say we are unagi!
Ross|Ross| It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!
Rachel|Rachel| Say it!
Ross|Ross| Y’know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
Joey|Joey| All right Carl, we’re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?
Carl|Other| Another Minute Maid fiasco.
Joey|Joey| That’s right! And what are you not gonna do?
Carl|Other| Well, I’m not gonna talk because…
Joey|Joey|  Damnit Carl! 
The Doctor|Other|   Can I have the next one please?  Joey and Tony Tribbiani. 
Joey|Joey| That’s us.
The Doctor|Other|  But uh, this is a study for identical twins.
Joey|Joey| That’s right, $2,000.
The Doctor|Other| But, you’re not identical twins.
Joey|Joey| Damnit Carl!
Chandler|Chandler| Oh my good God.

The Instructor|Other| Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!
Ross|Ross| Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m here. Maybe we could attack them together?  That-that’s a no.
