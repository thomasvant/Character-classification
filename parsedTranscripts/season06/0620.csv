Joey| The reactor’s gonna blow in three seconds, we’re never gonna make it!
Phoebe| You’ve got to get out of here! Save yourself!
Joey| No! I won’t leave you!
Phoebe| Don’t worry about me, I’m a robot! I’m just a machine!!
Joey| No you’re not! Not to me!
Phoebe|  Oh my God.
Joey| What?
Phoebe| I am extremely talented!
Joey| Yeah, you’re great! Okay, let’s take it from…
Phoebe|  No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
Joey| Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.
Phoebe| Oh yeah, you’re solid. Yeah, you’re just no me.
Joey| Y’know what? I think that’s enough for now. Yeah. I don’t want to be over rehearsed.
Phoebe|  Fine! I’ll do it without you!  I don’t need you or anybody else! I’m gonna make it on my own!  You’ll see!! You’ll all see!! 
Chandler|  So uh, what’s this thing you’re auditioning for?
Joey|" Oh, it’s a new TV show. Yeah. I’m up for the part of Mac Macaveli or ""Mac."" Yeah, I’m a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He’s a, he’s a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or ""C.H.E.E.S.E."""
Rachel| So Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Joey| That’s the title! Yeah! Y’know they really lucked out that the initials spell cheese.
Chandler| That is lucky.
Rachel| Huh—Wait so Joey if you get this, you’re gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you’ll be like the Big Cheese!  Or the Big Mac—Hey! You love those!
Joey| Well, don’t get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
Chandler| Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?
Joey| I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don’t know if I’m good enough.
Phoebe| I am.
Rachel| Joey, what are you talking about? You’re a terrific actor.
Joey| You really think so?
Rachel| Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
Chandler| Whoa, she's pretty. 
Joey| Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Rachel| I'm sorry, what?
Monica| What?
Ross| Excuse me?
Joey| It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. 
Chandler| Oh, ok.
Joey|"  There's my scene, there's my scene.  ""Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."" "
Joey|  Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.  
Joey| I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.  Monica:  Oh my God.  Joey: C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!  Chandler: Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.  Joey: Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!  Ross: You're right, you're right, it is.
Monica| Yes.
Ross| So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
Joey| All right well, I’m outta here. Wish me luck.
Phoebe| Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
Joey| Yeah, whatever. 
Ross| It’s your turn.
Chandler| Oh, are we playing this?!
Joey|  Hey.
Chandler| Hey! How’d the audition go?
Joey| Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn’t even be an actor!
Ross| Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn’t go well but it really did go well?
Joey| Yeah, did I fool ya?
Ross| Totally!
Chandler| So it did go well.
Joey| Oh, it went amazingly well!
Ross| Great!
Chandler| Oh that’s great!
Joey| Yeah-yeah, it’s down to me and two other guys.
Chandler| Oh my God!
Ross| Wow!
Joey| And I know both of them, they’re really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who’s always getting chased by those big flowers…
Ross| Oh, I love that guy! 
Chandler| Oh-oh, what are you doing?
Ross|  What am I doing?
Joey| I’m just so nervous! Y’know? The callback isn’t until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Chandler| Well, it is overdue.
Ross| Look, don’t worry. Okay? You’re gonna be fine.
Joey| There’s just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don’t know if you’d understand.
Ross| Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
Chandler|  Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!
Monica| Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Interviewer| Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
Monica| Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Interviewer| Don't, I like it dirty.
Monica| That's your call.
Interviewer| So, uh, what are you going to do next?
Monica| Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Interviewer| Are they, uh, firm?
Monica| They'r alright.
Interviewer| You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?
Monica| No really, they're OK.
Interviewer| You gonna slice them up real nice?
Monica| Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
Interviewer| Aaaahhhhhhh.
Monica| I'm outa here. 
Rachel|  Monica, I’m quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it!  I’m telling you I’m quitting! That’s it! I’m talking to my boss right now!  Yes I am!  Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. 
Monica| Well, what happened?
Phoebe| Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until... 
All| Ohhhhhh!
Ross| Oh my God!
Phoebe| And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. 
Monica| Was it...
Phoebe| Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
Ross| You ate my sandwich?
Dr. Leedbetter| It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Ross|  Oh-oh really? 
Dr. Leedbetter| Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
Ross|  What?
Dr. Leedbetter| Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
Ross| You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
Ross|  MY SANDWICH?!!!
Ross| MY SANDWICH!!!!!! 
Joey| I want this part so much! Y’know? If I don’t get this part I’m never gonna eat Macaroni and Cheese again!—No, I didn’t say that! That’s a lie.
Chandler| Oh come on guys, it’s not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren’t for  Monica’s allergies.  You’re right, I could never lie to you. She hates you.  Should I get that?  Hello?  Uh no, Joey’s not here right now. Can I take a message?  Yeah, okay so the audition has been moved from 5:00 to 2:30?  Okay great.  Bye. 
Monica|  Ahh! Aren’t you dressed yet?
Chandler|  Am I naked again?!
Monica| We’re supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Chandler| Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
Monica| Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Chandler| Oh right, your allergies.  All her, she hates you. 
Joey| Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?
Chandler| As crazy as soccer?
Joey|  Hello?  What are you talking about? The audition’s not ‘til 5:00!  Well, nobody told me!  Who’d you talk to?  Nevermind! 
Chandler| You mean you didn’t get it from this?
Joey| The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!
Chandler| Well, maybe we can fix it y’know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
Joey| How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could’ve turned my whole career around!
Chandler| I messed up. Okay? I’m sorry, I really messed up.
Joey| Hey, you don’t even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!
Chandler| Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody’s allowed one mistake, right?
Chandler| You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!
Phoebe| It's not that bad.
Chandler| Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. 
Phoebe| Chandler, Chandler.
Chandler| I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . .  Hi!
Chandler| Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…
Joey| And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Chandler| No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Joey| What?!! That’s even worse!!
Chandler| How is that worse?!
Joey| I don’t know! But it’s the same!
Chandler| You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Joey| Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Chandler| Look, I’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you’re not perfect! You’ve made some errors in judgment too!
Joey| Name one!
Chandler|  What happened?!!
Joey|  Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!
Chandler| What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
Joey| Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!
Chandler| So--You got in voluntarily?!
Joey| I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do?
Chandler| BEND OVER?!!!
Chandler| Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Lorraine| Hi, Joey.  Well well, look what you brought.
Chandler| ...And what did you bring?
Lorraine| She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Chandler| Janice?
Chandler| Janice?!
Janice| Oh.... my.... God.
Chandler| Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Ross| What?
Joey| No way! I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Chandler| Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
Ross| What?
Chandler| Cupping.
Joey| That's how they do pants! Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Ross| Yes, yes it is. In prison!
Joey| I said name one!
Chandler| I can’t believe I did this! What an idiot!
Monica| Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren’t any message you’ve forgotten to give me are there?  Apparently you’re not very good at it! I…
Chandler| Do you think he’ll ever forgive me?
Rachel| Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Chandler| Y’know what? I-I kinda have.
Rachel| Already? That’s pretty bad what you did.
Monica| Y’know what? He will forgive you. And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone just in case…  Okay…
Chandler| You didn’t see how mad he was, y’know?
Rachel| I’m sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y’know, you fight, you make up, it’s just the way it works.
Ross| It took two people to break up this relationship!!
Rachel| Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
Ross| I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!
Rachel| What?!!
Ross| I fell asleep!
Rachel|  You fell asleep?!
Ross| It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!!   Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’
Rachel| Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
Ross|  FINE BY ME!! 
Rachel| And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Chandler|  I KNEW IT!!!!
Monica| You had no right to go out with him.
Rachel| That is the most ridiculous...
Monica| You sold me out.
Rachel| I did not sell you out.
Monica| Yes you did. You absolutely sold me...
Rachel| Would you let me talk. 
Monica| Did you just flick me?
Rachel| OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus-  Ow. That hurt 
Phoebe| Oh! All right. Now, let's not do this!
Phoebe| Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
Phoebe| OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass.
  Monica| Ow! Ow! Ow!
Rachel| Ow! Ow! Ow!
Phoebe| I know! I know! I know! 
Phoebe| Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Rachel| Fine!
Monica| Fine!
Phoebe| There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Joey| Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Chandler| Oh my God! 
Joey| Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Joey| Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. 
Chandler| Joey? Got you a Joey Special, two pizzas! Joe?   Hello?  Damnit!  Hello?  No, Joey’s not here right now, but I can take a message I think.  He’s still got a chance for the part?! Oh, that’s great news!  Well no obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog.  Oh well, that’s great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you!  Yes!  Okay, Mac audition at 2:00. Allergy actor attacked.  By dog not flowers.
Joey| Hey!
Chandler| Please tell me you got the message!
Joey| What message?
Chandler| The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it, they needed to see you at 2 o’clock.
Joey| What?! It’s 6 o’clock!
Chandler| Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross’s! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
Joey| I can’t believe this Chandler!
Chandler| Sorry! I-I-I don’t know what to say.
Joey| Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!
Chandler|  Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Joey| Oh, well I’m uh…
Chandler| Y’know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Joey| Oh wow! Okay man, I’m sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
Chandler| Well that’s good. Because you didn’t! And I’m incredibly happy for ya!!
Joey|  That’s mean! You really had me going there!
Chandler| Oh, we could do this all day.
Joey| Yeah, you’re right. Okay look, listen, let’s talk about what a huge star I’m gonna be!
Chandler| You are gonna be a huge star! I’m gonna hug ya!
Joey| You hug me!
Chandler| All right!
Joey| Hey, do we do this too much?
Chandler| I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Joey| Yeah.
Joey| Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I’m not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.
Phoebe|  I can’t! My circuits are fried! They’re fried I tell you!!
Joey| Wow!  Well then I’ll just have to carry you.
Ross| That’ll be a neat trick, when you’re,  when you’re dead!
Joey| Ross, you don’t have to yell.
Ross| There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired. 
Phoebe|" I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, ""Ooh, where’d Ross go?"""
Ross| Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac…
Phoebe| Yeah?
Ross| Oh my God. I mean…
Joey| Y’know what? I think that’s enough for today. Thanks for your help! 
Phoebe|  He’s holding us back.
Ross| Totally.
