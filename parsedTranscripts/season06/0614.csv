Joey|3|  Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh… Oh wait, I don’t have to lie to you, you don’t live here anymore. Uh, I’m eating their food. What are you doing?
Rachel|1| Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Joey|3| Whoa, I didn’t know we could date your sister!
Monica|2| Joey we know you steal our food.
Chandler|4| I’m good.
Monica|2|  Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Rachel|1| Yeah. And y’know who should’ve shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Chandler|4|  Is that a swing?
Rachel|1| Oh don’t even ask!
Chandler|4| Yuck!
Joey|3| I can’t believe Ross went out with Rachel’s sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
Chandler|4| That was like 5 years ago.
Joey|3| Yeah you got 5 years left!
Chandler|4| Joey…
Joey|3| You wanna make it 6?!
Rachel|1| Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!
Ross|6| Hey!
Rachel|1|  I’ll take a coffee.  So how was your big date last night?
Ross|6| Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
Rachel|1| Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
Ross|6| I guess so.
Rachel|1| So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
Ross|6| No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Rachel|1| Oh, slides.  So really nothing happened.
Ross|6| Something could’ve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Rachel|1|" Right. Was it the, ""Please don’t show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"""
Ross|6| Anyway, if she, if she wasn’t in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
Rachel|1| She asked-asked you out again?
Ross|6| Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine’s Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Rachel|1| Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can’t! I can’t! I can’t! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can’t. It’s just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can’t do it! I can’t do it.
Ross|6|  Okay! Okay! Okay! It’s okay.  It’s okay. Hey, it’s too weird for you, I won’t see her again.
Rachel|1| Thank you. I…yeah.
Ross|6| I mean after tomorrow night.
Rachel|1| No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can’t! I can’t do it!  It’s just gonna freak me out!!!
Ross|6| Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I’ll-I’ll tell her tonight I can’t see her anymore.
Rachel|1| Ross thanks.
Ross|6| You want me to call her right now?
Rachel|1| Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that’s-that’s crazy—I mean that’s crazy. So what’s-what’s going on with you? What is going on with you?
Ross|6| Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
Rachel|1| Yeah do it now, call right now.
Monica|2|  This is my favorite part.
Phoebe|5|  Yeah me too.
Phoebe|5| Oh y’know what’s sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
Chandler|4|  Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
Joey|3|  You didn’t cry when Bambi’s mother died?
Chandler|4| Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Monica|2| Chandler there’s nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don’t have to be so macho all the time.
Chandler|4| I’m not macho.
Monica|2| Yeah you’re right. I don’t know what I was thinking.
Chandler|4| No, I guess I just never really cried. Y’know? I’m not a crying kind of guy.
Joey|3| Come on man there’s gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
Chandler|4| I’d be sad sure, but I wouldn’t cry.
Joey|3|" Okay, what if the puppy said, ""Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."""
Chandler|4| Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I’m rich!
Monica|2| Oh, I’ve got it! I have got it!  Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
Phoebe|5| All right, what’s going on there? 
Chandler|4| Oh, that’s Parent’s Day, first grade. That’s me with the janitor Martin.
Monica|2| Where were your parents?
Chandler|4| Oh they didn’t want to come!
Phoebe|5| Oh Chandler!
Monica|2| Poor thing!
Phoebe|5| So that story doesn’t make you cry?
Chandler|4| No! Look, I don’t cry! It’s not a big deal! Okay?!
Joey|3| No! It’s not okay! It’s not okay at all!! You’re dead inside!!
The Fan|0| Excuse me.
Phoebe|5| Yeah?
The Fan|0| Are you Phoebe Buffay?
Phoebe|5| Yeah.
The Fan|0| Can-can I get your autograph, I’m your biggest fan. 
Phoebe|5| Oh you’re my biggest fan? I’ve always wanted to meet you! Hi!  Sure! Yeah! 
The Fan|0| Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you’re really talented.
Phoebe|5| You’re just saying that because you’re my biggest fan.   Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay?  He’s a fan.  Bye! 
Joey|3|  So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
The Fan|0| I have no idea what you’re talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay’s autograph!
Joey|3| Oh, you’re Phoebe’s fan!
The Fan|0| Oh yeah! I’ve seen all her movies.
Joey|3| Movies?
The Fan|0| That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
Joey|3|  I don’t think so.
The Fan|0| No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren’t gonna believe this! 
Joey|3| Hey Gunther, don’t let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe’s a porn star!
Gunther|0| Well, I wouldn’t call her a star, but she’s really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.
Jill|0| Hey!
Rachel|1| Hey!
Jill|0| You’ll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn’t even tell me why!
Rachel|1| Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
Jill|0| Y’know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I’m not gonna date some random guy from your work.
Rachel|1| It’s not random, it’s Bob.
Jill|0| It’s probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn’t like the way I dress—No that can’t be it. It’s really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I’m so stupid! I’m just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
Rachel|1| No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
Jill|0| You asked him too?!
Rachel|1| Hm-mmm.
Jill|0| Why?!
Rachel|1| Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history…
Jill|0| I don’t understand, do you want to go out with Ross?
Rachel|1| No.
Jill|0| You don’t want him, but you don’t want me to have him?
Rachel|1|  Y’know Bob in Human Resources…
Jill|0| Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was!  You had me doubting my fashion sense!
Rachel|1| Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross! There’s a million other guys out there, you just…
Jill|0| Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
Rachel|1| I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Jill|0| Why are you so jealous of me?
Rachel|1| Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can’t have!
Jill|0| Can’t have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can’t have is dairy! 
Rachel|1| All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Jill|0| Who?!
Rachel|1| In Human Resources!!!!!!
Rachel|1| …I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
Monica|2| You’re jealous of Princess Caroline?
Rachel|1| Do I have my own castle?
Ross|6| Hey! Uh, Phoebe’s not here is she?
Rachel|1| No.
Monica|2|  Oh great! Did you get a movie?
Joey|3| Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don’t think it’s the kind you’re gonna like.
Chandler|4| You didn’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
Joey|3| Sort of…
Monica|2| Guys, what’s going on?
Joey|3|  Phoebe’s a porn star!
All|0| What?!!
Chandler|4| Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer.
Rachel|1| Oh my God!
Monica|2| That’s Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Joey|3| Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
Ross|6| And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn’t know he was in there. 
Rachel|1| Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this. Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.
Monica|2| This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y’know she had such a terrible childhood.
Chandler|4| Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do porn.
Monica|2| Yes, but you are dead inside.
Joey|3| All right well, I’d better take that back.
Monica|2| Wh-what, why?
Joey|3| We can’t watch that! I mean that’s Phoebe!
Monica|2| Yeah you’re right, we can’t—we shouldn’t watch this.
Rachel|1| Absolutely not.
Monica|2|  Y’know maybe a little bit!
Rachel|1| Probably just the first half.
Joey|3| No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe’s our friend! Well, I’m not gonna watch it!
Ross|6| Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Joey|3| Yeah.
Buffay|0| Ah, I thought I’d find you here, Nasforatool.
the Vampire Layer|0| Ah, I thought I’d find you here, Nasforatool.
The Vampire|0| Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
Buffay|0| Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
the Vampire Layer|0| Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
Monica|2| Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Chandler|4| Her ankle is what you’re watching?
Rachel|1| Well it’s hard to tell…  Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
Chandler|4| She’s just doing her job!
Joey|3|  You sick bastards!
Rachel|1| Oh, it’s a tattoo! That’s weird, Phoebe doesn’t… Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula!
Joey|3| Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Phoebe|5|  Hey! What’s up?  Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
Monica|2| Hey sweetie!
Chandler|4| Hey! 
Monica|2| Chicken Soup for the Soul? 
Chandler|4| There’s no back to this couch!
Monica|2| Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Chandler|4| Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead inside.
Monica|2| Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if you can’t cry, I love you.
Chandler|4| Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Monica|2| Stop it!
Chandler|4| No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we’re up at the altar and I’m like this. 
Monica|2| I won’t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here. 
Chandler|4| Yeah?
Monica|2| Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won’t matter to me.
Chandler|4| Okay, well I won’t uh, worry about this anymore then.
Monica|2|" And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you’re writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, ""I will always be with you,"" and you still can’t shed one tiny tear, I know you’ll be crying a river inside."
Chandler|4| Aww, I love you so…
Monica|2| What is wrong with you?!!!
Chandler|4| What?!
Monica|2| What?! You can’t shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
Chandler|4| So you didn’t mean any of that?!
Monica|2| No you robot!!
Ross|6| You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to…  Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that’s just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they’ve really taken a liking to me.  Uhh what’s-what’s-what’s the matter?
Jill|0| Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we’re not supposed to see each other anymore and I’m okay with that, it’s just that I don’t know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
Ross|6| Of course, what happened? 
Jill|0|  I don’t want to talk about it.
Ross|6| Okay, umm…
Jill|0| But you know what might really cheer me up?
Ross|6| What?
Jill|0| Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
Ross|6| Wow! Really?!
Jill|0| Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
Ross|6| Well, I’d love to! Here, you wait right here and I’ll go get the projector and my notes!
Jill|0| Oh great! Thanks Ross, you’re such a good friend!
Ross|6| Ohh!
Rachel|1| Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere.
Monica|2| No, I haven’t.
Rachel|1| Well, is Ross home? Maybe I’ll just call him to see if he’s actually seen her. 
Ursula|0| Who is it?
Phoebe|5| It’s Phoebe! Phoebe!
Ursula|0| Hey!
Phoebe|5|  Oh God. So-so you’re making porn movies.
Ursula|0| No I’m not.
Man’s Voice|0| We’re still rolling!
Phoebe|5| You’re making one right now!
Another Man’s Voice|0| Let’s go Phoebe!
Phoebe|5| And-and you’re using my name!
Ursula|0| Yeah, can I help you with something?
Same Man’s Voice|0| Phoebe, come on!
Phoebe|5| Look, I’m talking right now! You’re—you mean her.
Ursula|0| Y’know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
Phoebe|5| What?!
Ursula|0| Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.
Phoebe|5| No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you!  And shame on all of you! You’re disgusting! Especially you  with that! 
Ross|6| Slides are almost ready.
Jill|0| Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
Ross|6| Uh okay, well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen.
Jill|0| Oh great! 
Ross|6|  Hello?
Rachel|1| What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
Ross|6| O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she’s really upset we’re just talking.
Rachel|1| Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
Ross|6| So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
Rachel|1| Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
Ross|6| Y’know what? I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to you later. Good-bye.  Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me.
Jill|0| So? 
Phoebe|5| Hey!
Joey|3| Hey!
Phoebe|5| So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
Joey|3| Oh no, not you too!
Phoebe|5| No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were a lot of them.
Joey|3| Nice!
Phoebe|5| Um-mmm, and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
Joey|3| That’s great, but isn’t it gonna bother that people still think you’re a porn star?
Phoebe|5| Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
Joey|3| You do?
Phoebe|5| Yeah.   You’re trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I’ll give you a hint. From porn! Okay?  Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie!  See?
Joey|3| Yeah.
Chandler|4| Hey.
Ross|6|  You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Rachel|1| Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Ross|6| Umm, she kissed me.
Rachel|1| What?! You kissed!
Chandler|4|  Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Monica|2|  Shhhh!!!
Ross|6| Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Rachel|1| Well, it doesn’t sound like it! I mean, it’s pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don’t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
Ross|6| Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it. I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking…
Rachel|1| Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! Y’know what? Let me give you something to think about! 
Ross|6| Oh wait—hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Rachel|1| Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that.
Ross|6| Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
Rachel|1| What?!
Ross|6| No, I mean, look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
Rachel|1| Wow. I, I don’t even know what to say. Thank you. 
Ross|6| You’re welcome. 
Monica|2| Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
Chandler|4|  I just don’t see why those two can’t work things out!
Jill|0| All right, I’m leaving! Because I’m not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That’s you Rachel!
Rachel|1| Yeah, I got that.
Jill|0|  And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
Ross|6| You take care Jill.
Jill|0|  Okay, see ya! 
Rachel|1| Bye-bye-e!
Monica|2| Bye.
Chandler|4|  I-I can’t believe Jill’s gone.  I can’t help it, I opened a gate.
