Rachel|1| 
Joey|3| I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Joey, please don’t do that
Monica|2| I think it’s best that we just forget about it
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| All right that’s it, school is in session
Joey|3| 
Monica|2|  My God

Chandler|4|
Ross|6| So why don’t you quit
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| You don’t think I’ve tried
Chandler|4| You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month
Chandler|4| No, they make you go all the way down there
Chandler|4| Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you
Chandler|4| Then they bring out Maria
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Who is Maria
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Oh Maria
Chandler|4| You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| No
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| So you’re strong enough to face her on your own
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Oh no, you’ll have to come
Chandler|4|
Mr. Treeger|0|: Tribbiani
Mr. Treeger|0| Hold on, I’ll get the plunger
Mr. Treeger|0|
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3| You hold on pal
Joey|3| Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry
Joey|3| So now, you’re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord
Joey|3|
Mr. Treeger|0|: And tell him what
Mr. Treeger|0|
Joey|3| Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry
Joey|3|
Mr. Treeger|0|: Yeah
Mr. Treeger|0| Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968
Mr. Treeger|0|
Joey|3| I have actually not heard of that
Joey|3|
Mr. Treeger|0|: Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it
Mr. Treeger|0| I’ve been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don’t need this grief
Mr. Treeger|0| I’m gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother’s apartment
Mr. Treeger|0| Your friends are outta here pal
Mr. Treeger|0|
Joey|3| Why don’t you tell me something I don’t know
Joey|3| 
Phoebe|5| Oh please, somebody tell me I don’t have to go to work today
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| What’s the matter
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| So do them for free
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Oh no, it is forbidden
Phoebe|5| No-no, Mrs
Phoebe|5| Potter fires people for fooling around with clients
Phoebe|5| And it’s against my oath as a masseuse
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| They make you take an oath
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| No, I made myself take an oath
Phoebe|5| Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared
Phoebe|5| Yeah, that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Why don’t you just give him to somebody else
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| No, I can handle it
Phoebe|5| No, I’m a professional
Phoebe|5| 
Rachel|1| Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Wow

Chandler|4|
Monica|2| You’re gonna do some feet flirtin’
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| I don’t what your talking about
Phoebe|5| 
Ross|6| Then how do you explain the toe ring
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Because it’s Arabian princess day at work

Phoebe|5| Leave me alone
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Oh
Rachel|1| My hero
Rachel|1| What happened
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he’d better come up here and apologize
Joey|3| I’ll see you later
Joey|3| 
Monica|2| What a minute, what did he say
Monica|2|
Joey|3| He said that he wasn’t gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he’s gonna do is have you evicted—I’ll see you later
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| You got us evicted
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| I told you not to go down there
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Well he made Rachel cry
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Rachel always cries
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| That’s not true
Rachel|1| 
Monica|2| Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him
Monica|2| I mean you suck like you’ve never sucked before
Monica|2|
Joey|3| All right
Joey|3| I’ll try
Joey|3| But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Go
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| All right, all right, all right
Joey|3|  I mean I’ll have to check with him first, but I’ll think he’ll be cool with it
