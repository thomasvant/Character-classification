Ross|6|
Janice|0| Oh boy, I just love to sing
Janice|0|
Chandler|4| Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River
Chandler|4|
Janice|0| Oh, look at us
Janice|0| Who would’ve thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails
Janice|0| 
Chandler|4|  Okay, we have to talk
Chandler|4| I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship…
Janice|0| I know

Monica|2| Done
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Yep
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1|  Hey
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3| What’s up
Joey|3|
Monica|2| This switch thing has been driving me crazy
Monica|2| So I turned it off and checked every outlet
Monica|2| Now, four of them don’t work
Monica|2| Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch
Monica|2| So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is
Monica|2|
Joey|3|  I bet I stopped listening before you did
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Y’know, you-you also could’ve used uh, lamps and then followed the light
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Yeah, well, I’m using noise
Monica|2| Okay
Monica|2| All right
Monica|2| So, is everybody ready
Monica|2| Here we go
Monica|2|  I hear something
Monica|2| I hear something
Monica|2| Where is it
Monica|2| 
Rachel|1| It’s coming from Joey
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Oh my God, that’s so freaky
Phoebe|5| Turn him off
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| Ooh, hey, could we put on the news
Phoebe|5| I think it might be raining
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Oh, just hold on a second
Ross|6| I’m watching this rugby thing on ESPN
Ross|6| I don’t know what the big deal is
Ross|6| I’m man enough to play this sport
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Dude, you’re not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport
Joey|3|
Janice|0|  Hey there Ross
Janice|0|
Ross|6|  Hey
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5|  Janice
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Y’know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack
Chandler|4|
Janice|0| Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn’t really leave me much choice
Janice|0| Did you
Janice|0|
Chandler|4| Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Hey-hey, what’s going on
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Oh, I’m packing
Chandler|4| Y’know I’m-I’m packing ‘cause I’m moving to Yemen tomorrow
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Thanks for telling me
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen, it’s the only way I can get rid off her
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Ohhhh, good one
Joey|3| And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country
Joey|3|
Janice|0|  Chandler
Janice|0| Come on, I’m gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes
Janice|0| It’s a real space saver
Janice|0|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller
Phoebe|5|
Janice|0| Okay, Chandler, come on
Janice|0|
Chandler|4|  Okay
Chandler|4|  Joey, trade lives with me
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Nope
Joey|3|  Man look at this
Joey|3| Ross, I can’t believe you said you’d play rugby
Joey|3| I mean look how brutal this is
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Hey, I can handle it
Ross|6| All right
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| That’s ‘cause-‘cause you’re mom’s dog kept-kept looking at me
Ross|6|
Joey|3|  Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here
Joey|3| That’s called a scrum, okay
Joey|3| It’s kinda like a huddle
Joey|3|
Ross|6| And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Ross
Joey|3|  They’re gonna kill you
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Well, why are you doing this anyway
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Well, you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with
Ross|6| I mean, he’s like Joe Rugby
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| You’re kidding
Phoebe|5| And he plays rugby
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| That’s so funny
Phoebe|5|  Ohh
Phoebe|5| I see how you did that
Phoebe|5| All right
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious
Ross|6| So I’m gonna show her how tough I really am
Ross|6|
Rachel|1|  I’m sorry
Rachel|1| I’m sorry
Rachel|1| You’re right, you are a tough guy
Rachel|1| You’re the toughest palaeontologist I know
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself
Joey|3| It’s not like he’s…Chandler
Joey|3|
Chandler|4|  Thanks
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Look, don’t worry about me
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6| I’ll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball
Ross|6| I’ll uh, I’ll be that guy right out of the circle
Ross|6| 
All|0| Oh
All|0|
Rachel|1| Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross
Joey|3| Stay away from that guy , and that guy 
Joey|3| And that one—Dude
Joey|3| They’re all huge
Joey|3|
Ross|6| They don’t look any bigger than me
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you
Joey|3| So you look bigger to you from where you are
Joey|3|
Emily|0| I’m just going to say hi to the lads

Rachel|1| Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| He asked you out
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| No
Rachel|1| But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Saucy
Monica|2|
Rachel|1|  What are these
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Electrical plans for the building
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Okay, okay, okay should I be scared
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| I know that switch does something, okay
Monica|2| So-so I went down to city hall and got these
Monica|2| All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Wow
Rachel|1| If only more people knew
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport
Chandler|4|
Janice|0| Oh please
Janice|0| Every moment is precious
Janice|0| Y’know
Janice|0| Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving
Janice|0|
Chandler|4| Well, we’re really not that close
Chandler|4|  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then
Chandler|4|
Janice|0| On no
Janice|0| No
Janice|0| It’s not good-bye, I’m not leaving until you get on that plane
Janice|0|
Chandler|4| Okay

Chandler|4|
Ticket Counter Attendant|0| One ticket to Yemen
Ticket Counter Attendant|0|
Chandler|4| Oh no-no-no, no

Chandler|4|
Ticket Counter Attendant|0| I’m sorry sir, I don’t understand
Ticket Counter Attendant|0| 
Chandler|4| What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with
Chandler|4|
Ticket Counter Attendant|0| Are you travelling with a child
Ticket Counter Attendant|0|
Chandler|4| No
Chandler|4| All right, y’know what, she’s  gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card
Chandler|4|
Ticket Counter Attendant|0| Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don’t take library cards
Ticket Counter Attendant|0|
Janice|0| What’s the matter
Janice|0| Is something wrong
Janice|0| Do you have to stay
Janice|0|
Chandler|4| American Express
Chandler|4|
Emily|0| I can’t believe they’re doing that to him
Emily|0| I told them to go easy on him
Emily|0|
Phoebe|5| No offence but, y’know sometimes it’s hard to understand you, y’know with the accent, so…
Emily|0| That’s just halftime, there’s more of this
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Did you see me
Ross|6| I was pretty good, huh
Ross|6| That is one fun game

Joey|3|
Ross|6| I don’t care
Ross|6| I am not quitting
Ross|6| I insist on finishing this game
Ross|6|
Emily|0| All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you
Emily|0|
Ross|6| No, God no
Ross|6| That is no place for a woman
Ross|6| Those guys will grab anything
Ross|6|
Emily|0| No
Emily|0| That’s not what I’m saying
Emily|0| I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain
Emily|0|
Ross|6| I like that
Ross|6|
Emily|0| Yeah
Emily|0| Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle

Monica|2| I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that picture
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Oh my God

Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Okay, but there is a wire back there
Monica|2| I mean that switch is connected to something
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| I don’t care
Rachel|1| The wires have come loose in your head
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| And did you
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| No
Monica|2| It disappears back there behind that baseboard
Monica|2| For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs
Monica|2|
Monica|2| But it didn’t
Monica|2| Say hello to Mrs
Monica|2| Chatracus
Monica|2|

Ross|6|
Emily|0| You really enjoyed yourself didn’t you
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Please
