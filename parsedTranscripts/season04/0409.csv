Rachel|1| Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something
Rachel|1| There’s an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss…
Joanna|0|  Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| Well, actually, I meant for me
Rachel|1| The hiring committee is meeting people all day and…
Joanna|0| Oh
Joanna|0| Well, I wish I could say no, but you can’t stay my assistant forever
Joanna|0| Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| God, I am so glad you don’t have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn’t even consider applying
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| Really
Joanna|0| Well, in that case…
Rachel|1|  And that’s I’m so glad… there’s no problem
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| That’s fine, actually I’m on the hiring committee, so there’ll be at least one friendly face
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| Ohh
Rachel|1| That’s great
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| You know, Junior Miss is where I started
Joanna|0| Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| Really
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| No-ho-ho
Joanna|0|  Yeah
Joanna|0|  I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don’t you worry, I’m sure with your qualifications you won’t need to sleep with some guy to get that job
Joanna|0| Although, I might need some convincing
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| Well, I, umm…
Joanna|0| Kidding
Joanna|0| God, I feel wild today
Joanna|0|
Chandler|4| Oh man
Chandler|4| I am so excited—I may vomit
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Will you calm down, he’s just a human guy
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Look you don’t understand, Gandolf is amazing
Chandler|4| Y’know you’re never know what’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3| Really
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Oh yeah, it’s beautiful country up there
Chandler|4|
Ross|6|  Hey

Chandler|4|
Mr. Posner|0| You have a very impressive resume, Ms
Mr. Posner|0| Green
Mr. Posner|0| I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system
Mr. Posner|0|
Rachel|1| Thank you
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| Filing system
Joanna|0| Oh-oh
Joanna|0| You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders
Joanna|0|  It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets
Joanna|0| 
Rachel|1| Well, they uh, they-they do more than that
Rachel|1|
Mrs. Lynch|0| I notice that you’ve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities
Mrs. Lynch|0|
Rachel|1| Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| Oh
Joanna|0| And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me
Joanna|0| It’s amazing how she gets it right almost every time
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| Oh yes, well there’s the coffee too
Joanna|0|  Rachel can carry two things at once
Joanna|0|
Mr. Posner|0| Yes, that’s very good
Mr. Posner|0| Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers
Mr. Posner|0|
Rachel|1| Yes, I realize that…
Joanna|0|  And Rachel shouldn’t have any problem with that
Joanna|0| The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| I love working with designers
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| With them, under them, what’s the difference
Joanna|0| Eh, Rach
Joanna|0|
Monica|2| Hey

Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Oh, okay

Phoebe|5| Sure, but I’d have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head
Phoebe|5|"""  Wow"
Phoebe|5| You really laid into this place
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Hey, they don’t pay me a penny a word to make friends
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Ooh, I gotta go
Phoebe|5| I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Oh
Monica|2| Do you need me to go with you
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| No-no, it’s okay
Phoebe|5| But are we sure we don’t want the waterbed
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Haven’t we made this decision
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, all right
Phoebe|5| 
Monica|2| Bye

Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| No
Monica|2| Phoebe
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Hey, Monica
Phoebe|5|
Allesandro|0|  I want a retraction
Allesandro|0| Our food is not inedible swill
Allesandro|0|
Monica|2| I couldn’t eat it
Monica|2| I had five friends who couldn’t eat it, and one of them eats books
Monica|2|
Allesandro|0| Well our service is not grossly incompetent
Allesandro|0|
Monica|2| The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants
Monica|2|
Allesandro|0| Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not
Allesandro|0|
Monica|2| All right, that I’ll retract
Monica|2| But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn’t it
Monica|2| You’re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice
Monica|2| You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery
Monica|2| 
Allesandro|0| Hey
Allesandro|0| I’m proud of that sauce, it’s delicious
Allesandro|0|
Monica|2| Oh my God
Monica|2| You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good
Monica|2|
Monica|2| Where are you even from
Monica|2|
Allesandro|0|  Lebanon
Allesandro|0|
Monica|2| Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste like
Monica|2| Come on, hand me them
Monica|2|
Allesandro|0| How long is this gonna take
Allesandro|0| ‘Cause I got another critic to go yell at
Allesandro|0|
Rachel|1|  Umm, Joanna
Rachel|1| I wanna talk about that interview
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| I thought it went very well
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| No
Rachel|1| It didn’t
Rachel|1| That’s what I want to talk to you about
Rachel|1|  Now, just to brief you…  I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| Rachel, please, don’t make a scene
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| There’s nobody here
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| Sophie, get in here
Joanna|0|  You see
Joanna|0| Now you’re making Sophie uncomfortable
Joanna|0|
Sophie|0| She’s not making me uncomfortable
Sophie|0|
Joanna|0| Congratulations
Joanna|0| You now just crossed the line into completely useless
Joanna|0| Get out
Joanna|0| 
Rachel|1| Do you want me to quit
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| What
Joanna|0|
Joanna|0| What would make you think that
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant
Rachel|1| Y’know what
Rachel|1| I am just gonna pack up my desk,  and I will be gone by the end of the day
Rachel|1|  Well, I guess there’s no use to me sticking around ‘til the end of the day
Rachel|1| 
Joanna|0| Wait-wait-wait-wait
Joanna|0| You can put your sad little muffin back in it’s drawer
Joanna|0| If you must know the truth, I didn’t want to lose a perfectly good assistant
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| That’s why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking…
Rachel|1| My drinking
Rachel|1| 
Joanna|0| Oh, I must’ve said that after you left
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| Said what
Rachel|1| Exactly
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| That you enjoyed the occasional drink…ing binge
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| Oh my God
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| Ohh, that is it
Rachel|1| I’m leaving
Rachel|1| You are just a horrible person
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait
Joanna|0|
Joanna|0| If you’re gonna get all sensitive about it
Joanna|0| I don’t want to lose you
Joanna|0| What if I, create a position for you
Joanna|0| I’ll make you an assistant buyer in this department
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| Say more things like that
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| You can have your own office, and a raise
Joanna|0| Effective tomorrow
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| I’d need an expense account
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| Done
Joanna|0|

Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| All right

Chandler|4| Does it have to be so loud
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| I can’t hear a word you’re saying, my ears are ringing so bad
Joey|3|
Ross|6| I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y’know

Ross|6|
Ross|6| How sad are we
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Yeah, I know
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Y’know what
Chandler|4| We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’re just not 21 anymore
Chandler|4| Y’know
Chandler|4| I’m 29 years old, damnit
Chandler|4| And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Yeah

Monica|2|  Ohh, here you are
Monica|2| Y’know, I’m-I’m glad you decided to hear me out
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Okay, I’m hearing
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| I’ve been doing a lot of thinking
Monica|2| A lot
Monica|2| And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van
Monica|2| Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| What
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Or
Monica|2| A bakery delivery person
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| I wa-I wa-I wa…
Monica|2| Pizza
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Monica
Phoebe|5| 
Monica|2| All right, I’ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to deliver
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Okay
Monica|2| I’m guessing that if you don’t want to deliver, you probably don’t want to pick stuff up either
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Y’know what, let’s do the catering business
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Really
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| Are you sure
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you
Monica|2| Y’know what, it’d be, it’d be fun

Phoebe|5| Okay, ooh, let’s plan the wedding reception
Phoebe|5|  Wow
Phoebe|5| You really wanted me to do something with this van
Phoebe|5|  Y’know what, I want you to take the chef job
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Really
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5| That’s what you really want
Phoebe|5| Yeah, I don’t want to be the reason you’re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don’t want to be the reason I’m unhappy
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Thank you
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Oh, hi Mrs
Rachel|1| Lynch
Rachel|1| Is Joanna in already
Rachel|1|
Mrs. Lynch|0| Oh my goodness
Mrs. Lynch|0| You haven’t heard
Mrs. Lynch|0|
Rachel|1| Heard what
Rachel|1|
Mrs. Lynch|0| Joanna passed away last night
Mrs. Lynch|0|
Rachel|1| Oh my God
Rachel|1| How
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Mrs. Lynch|0| Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab
Mrs. Lynch|0|
Rachel|1| Oh my God
Rachel|1| Oh, I cannot believe it
Rachel|1|
Mrs. Lynch|0| I know
Mrs. Lynch|0|
Rachel|1| Oh, God
Rachel|1| Oh, God
Rachel|1|  Oh God
Rachel|1|
Mrs. Lynch|0| I didn’t realize that she was so close
Mrs. Lynch|0|
Rachel|1| Yes, so close
Rachel|1| Mrs
Rachel|1| Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us
Rachel|1| But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before… it happened
Rachel|1|
Mrs. Lynch|0| No
Mrs. Lynch|0| Nothing
Mrs. Lynch|0| Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later
Mrs. Lynch|0|
Rachel|1| Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer
Rachel|1|
Mrs. Lynch|0|  No, I’m sorry
Mrs. Lynch|0| I have to go
Mrs. Lynch|0| 
Sophie|0|  Good morning
Sophie|0|
Rachel|1| Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn’t hear about Joanna…
Sophie|0| I sure did
Sophie|0| 
Allesandro|0| I’m so excited about having Monica come on board with us
Allesandro|0| Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it’s like losing a member of the family
Allesandro|0| Of course, that literally is the case for several of you
Allesandro|0| Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we’re gonna miss him
Allesandro|0| Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review
Allesandro|0| So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef
Allesandro|0|
Monica|2| Umm, I just wanna say, uh  that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Monica|2|  Are you gonna kill me
Monica|2|
