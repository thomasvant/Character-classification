Monica|2| Guys, hurry up
Monica|2| The flight leaves in four hours
Monica|2| It could take time to get a taxi
Monica|2| There could be traffic
Monica|2| The plane could leave early
Monica|2| When we get to London, there could be a line at customs
Monica|2| Come on
Monica|2|
Monica|2| 
Chandler|4| Six-hour trip to London
Chandler|4| That’s a lot of Monica
Chandler|4|

Rachel|1|" Who are you saying ""check"" too"
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Myself
Monica|2| Y’know for remembering to pack a thing
Monica|2| Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check
Monica|2|  My mom does it, I never realized it was weird
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven
Phoebe|5| Well, actually, she only did it the one time
Phoebe|5| But it was pretty weird
Phoebe|5|

Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Because, I can’t

Joey|3|
Chandler|4| I am, I’m ignoring you
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Okay, here
Joey|3|  I wanna be the on camera guy
Joey|3| All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey
Joey|3| 
Chandler|4| Oh, what the hell is that
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| It’s London, baby
Joey|3| All right, the hotel’s here
Joey|3|  Wait
Joey|3| No, we wanna go… No
Joey|3| I know
Joey|3|  I’m gonna have to go into the map
Joey|3| 
Chandler|4| Okay, if you see a little version of me in there
Chandler|4| Kill it
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| I got it
Joey|3|  Here we go
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| Listen-listen, we’re not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Shhh
Joey|3|  Man, you made me lose it
Joey|3| 
Emily|0| …and that was all before 10 o’clock
Emily|0| The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon
Emily|0| And then the florist phoned to say there aren’t any tulips
Emily|0| Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome
Emily|0| We’re not gonna be…
Ross|6| Whoa-whoa-whoa
Ross|6| Emily,  honey, okay
Ross|6|
Emily|0| Well, up yours too
Emily|0|
Ross|6| What
Ross|6|
Ross|6| No
Ross|6| No
Ross|6| That’s-that’s time-out
Ross|6|
Emily|0| Sorry
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Sweetie, you gotta relax
Ross|6| Everything’s gonna be great, okay
Ross|6| Come on
Ross|6| Come on
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Chicken Kiev
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Um-hmm
Ross|6| Doesn’t that sound delicious at the last minute
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Yeah, y’know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken
Monica|2| And, you wouldn’t have to worry about the salmonella
Monica|2|  So, I can’t wait to see this place you’re getting married
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Yeah
Ross|6| Yeah
Ross|6| Yes, this place is beautiful
Ross|6| Emily’s parents got married here
Ross|6|
Emily|0| I still can’t believe they’re tearing it down
Emily|0| It really is the most lovely building you’ll ever see
Emily|0| I mean it’s over…  Oh my God
Emily|0|
Monica|2| It’s nice
Monica|2|
Emily|0| Oh
Emily|0| Oh
Emily|0| 
Emily|0|  Oh
Emily|0| Oh my God
Emily|0| How can this be happening
Emily|0| What are we going to do
Emily|0|
Ross|6| It’s all right
Ross|6| Everything’s gonna be all right
Ross|6|
Emily|0| How’s it gonna be all right
Emily|0|
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Uh-huh, I see that
Ross|6|
Monica|2|  Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened
Monica|2| 
Ross|6| What
Ross|6| What
Ross|6|
Monica|2| They torn it down a few days early
Monica|2|
Joey|3| All right
Joey|3| Westminster Abbey
Joey|3| Hands down, best Abbey I’ve ever seen
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3|  Okay
Joey|3| What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| I think it’s great
Chandler|4| It’s great
Chandler|4| Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Really
Joey|3| To what
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| To Put the Camera Away
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Man, you are Westminster Crabby
Joey|3| 
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Oh, honey
Rachel|1| Don’t get up
Rachel|1| What do you need
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Oh, no
Phoebe|5| Oh, nothing
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Come on
Rachel|1| I am here to take care of you
Rachel|1| What do you need
Rachel|1| Anything
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Okay, I have a wedgie
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Okay, that is all you
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| So-so, what do you want for lunch
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Oh, I don’t know
Rachel|1| I guess we have to eat
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, I do
Phoebe|5| What’s the matter
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross
Rachel|1| I shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work
Rachel|1| He seemed so mad at me
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Eh, don’t be so hard on yourself
Phoebe|5| If someone I was still in love with was getting married…
Rachel|1|  Still in love with
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| 
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| I’m not in love with Ross
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5| Good
Phoebe|5| Yeah, me neither
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Phoebe, I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable
Rachel|1| Not because, I’m still in love with him
Rachel|1| I mean, hey, y’know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y’know
Rachel|1| Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don’t mean love
Rachel|1| I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1| But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him
Rachel|1| Y’know
Rachel|1| I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him—Ohh
Rachel|1| Oh my God
Rachel|1| Oh my—why didn’t you tell me
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| We thought you knew
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| We
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, we all know
Phoebe|5| We talk about it all the time
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| You all know
Rachel|1| Does Ross know
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Oh no, Ross doesn’t know anything
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Oh, I can not believe you didn’t tell me
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Well, because we thought you knew
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| It’s so obvious
Phoebe|5|" God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean"
Phoebe|5|""""
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3|
The Vendor|0| So, what are you guys in the market for
The Vendor|0| We’ve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards
The Vendor|0|
The Vendor|0|
The Vendor|0|
Joey|3| Check this out
Joey|3| Huh
Joey|3|  Yeah
Joey|3| That’s the stuff
Joey|3| What do you think
Joey|3|
Chandler|4|" Well, I don’t have to buy that, ""I’m with stupid"" T-shirt anymore"
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Well, I like it
Joey|3| Here you go
Joey|3| 
Chandler|4| All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you
Chandler|4| Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Oh, I embarrass you
Joey|3| 
Chandler|4| How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you
Chandler|4|
The Vendor|0| He’s just jealous
The Vendor|0| You’ll fit right in; all Londoners wear them
The Vendor|0|
Chandler|4| Oh really
Chandler|4| Then how come no one here is wearing them
Chandler|4|
The Vendor|0|  They’re all tourists
The Vendor|0|
Chandler|4| All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Oh yeah
Joey|3|  If you’re gonna make me choose between you and the hat
Joey|3| I choose the hat
Joey|3|
The Vendor|0| Good choice
The Vendor|0|
Joey|3| Thanks
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Okay, wait
Chandler|4| All right, that’s it, okay, I’m out of here
Chandler|4| I am not going to be embarrassed anymore
Chandler|4| 
Emily|0| Hello
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Hey
Ross|6| I just spoke to your dad, and you know what
Ross|6| He seems to think we’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding
Ross|6|
Emily|0| We don’t have to
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Whoa-whoa-what
Ross|6| You found a place
Ross|6|
Emily|0| No
Emily|0| But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit
Emily|0|
Ross|6| She said what
Ross|6|
Emily|0|" She said, ""If I’m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it"
Emily|0|""""
Ross|6| Postpone it
Ross|6| Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding
Ross|6| Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh
Ross|6|  This isn’t right
Ross|6|
Emily|0| I realize that people are going to be disappointed
Emily|0| But, I’m sure they’ll come back when we can do it right
Emily|0|
Ross|6| I can’t ask people to do that
Ross|6| Would you ask people to do that
Ross|6| 
Emily|0| Don’t you point your pants at me
Emily|0|  We have no choice
Emily|0| Anywhere that’s half-decent would’ve be booked months ago, Ross don’t you understand
Emily|0| This is our wedding I’m talking about
Emily|0|
Ross|6| The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option
Ross|6| This is when we’re getting married
Ross|6|
Emily|0| So what are you saying
Emily|0| It’s now or never
Emily|0|
Ross|6| No
Ross|6| I’m saying it’s now
Ross|6| 
Emily|0| Or
Emily|0|
Ross|6| There’s no ‘or’ in mind
Ross|6| What is wrong with these pants
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Emily|0| It’s not the pants
Emily|0| It’s you that is backwards
Emily|0| And if, and if you don’t understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn’t get married at all
Emily|0| 
Ross|6|  No, wait
Ross|6| Emily
Ross|6| No, wait, stop
Ross|6| Emily, please—
Phoebe|5| Hey
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1|  Hi
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Manhattan does not have enough stores
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Well, I think I can help you get over him
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| You can
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5| I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Um-hmm
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| And a small piece of chocolate
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| And a glass of tepid water
Phoebe|5| 
Rachel|1| Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Uh, only if you have the hiccups too
Phoebe|5| Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me
Phoebe|5| I just didn’t feel like getting up
Phoebe|5| Okay, I’m gonna show you a picture of Ross
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5| And you’re going to remember all of the bad things about him
Phoebe|5| All right
Phoebe|5| Really focus on his flaws
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| I can do that
Rachel|1| I certainly did it when we were going out
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5| Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he’s such a great guy
Phoebe|5| Here
Phoebe|5|  Okay, now, close your eyes
Phoebe|5| And imagine that you’re with Ross okay and imagine that you’re kissing him
Phoebe|5| And you’re-you’re running your hands all over his body
Phoebe|5| And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it’s some kind of grease, it’s—uck
Phoebe|5| Hah
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| I don’t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought
Phoebe|5| Umm, let’s try some uh, aversion therapy
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| All right
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| So uh, now look at the picture…
Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| All right, and umm…  
Rachel|1| Ow
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Okay, how do you feel now
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Well, I like you less
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Hey
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3| Oh
Joey|3|  Sorry
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| No-no-no, y’know what
Chandler|4| I really shouldn’t have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn’t cool
Chandler|4| And if it makes you feel any better, I’ve had a really lousy day
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Me too
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yeah
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Noo
Joey|3|
Joey|3| I’ve had the best day ever
Joey|3| Dude, check this out
Joey|3|
Monica|2|  Hey
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Sh-shh-shh
Joey|3| 
Joey|3|  Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat
Joey|3| 
Fergie|0|  Okay, so umm, what’s your friend’s name
Fergie|0|
Joey|3|  Oh, Chandler
Joey|3|
Fergie|0| Hi Chandler
Fergie|0|  
Chandler|4| That’s… That’s was…
Monica|2| Oh my God
Monica|2|
Joey|3| That’s Fergie baby
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Fergie|0| Joey says you don’t really like his hat, but I think it’s kinda dashing
Fergie|0|
Chandler|4| How did you
Chandler|4| How
Chandler|4| How
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right
Joey|3| So, I’m in my map and-and… Hey
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Hey
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Hi
Ross|6| I understand you had a little talk with Emily
Ross|6|
Monica|2|  Yes, I did
Monica|2| And you are welcome
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Am I
Ross|6|
Ross|6| And was it your idea to postpone the wedding
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Umm…
Chandler|4| I’m gonna go to the bathroom
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Wait up
Joey|3| 
Ross|6| Hey-hey, since you’re the ‘fix-it’ lady, here’s a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn’t want to have the wedding at all
Ross|6|
Monica|2| She said that
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Yeah
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Why
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Ross|6| I don’t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Oh my God
Monica|2| You’re even dumber than I am
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Excuse me
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding
Monica|2|
Ross|6| I don’t know
Ross|6| A month
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Emily has probably been planning it since she was five
Monica|2| Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head
Monica|2| That’s what we did
Monica|2| We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top
Monica|2|  Thanks
Monica|2| But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was
Monica|2|
Ross|6| I had no idea
Ross|6| And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Sometimes we were
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Come on
Ross|6| You gotta help me figure out what to do
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Okay
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Come on
Ross|6| 
Chandler|4| That was pretty intense huh
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3|  Hey, I hope Ross didn’t think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here
Joey|3|
Chandler|4|  I hope he did
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Hello
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3|  Hey, Pheebs
Joey|3| It’s Joey
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Hey, Joey
Phoebe|5| Hey
Phoebe|5| Ooh
Phoebe|5| Ooh
Phoebe|5| I just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway
Phoebe|5| And I was gonna go over and say ‘hi
Phoebe|5|’ but then I figured, he doesn’t care if he looks like you
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| That just cost me four bucks
Joey|3| But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Ohh, they’re having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe
Phoebe|5| Aunt Rachel hasn’t been helpful at all
Phoebe|5| So, do you miss me
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Kinda, but I’ve just been having way too much fun
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| So you’re not homesick yet
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| No, I don’t think so
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| All right, the seven of us miss you
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Who’s seven
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Y’know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies…
Joey|3| Ahh, the babies miss me
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Ooh, the pizza guy’s here
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| What
Joey|3| You ordered pizza without me
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5| But y’know we were thinking about you, y’know we ordered the Joey Special
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Two pizzas
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Yep
Phoebe|5| Okay, gotta go, talk to you later
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Wait, well, where did you get it from
Joey|3|
Joey|3| 
Emily|0| Monica, why have you brought me here of all places
Emily|0|
Emily|0|
Monica|2| You’ll see
Monica|2|
Emily|0| I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen
Emily|0|
Emily|0| Oh God
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6| But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay
Ross|6| And-and y’know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles…
Monica|2| And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay
Monica|2| And the chairs can face this way , and…  You go
Monica|2|
Ross|6| But-but, if you don’t love this, we’ll do it in any other place at any other time
Ross|6| Really, it’s fine, whatever you want
Ross|6|
Emily|0| It’s perfect
Emily|0|
Ross|6| And, I don’t know, if it starts to rain…
Emily|0| Well then we’ll get wet
Emily|0| 
Monica|2| Ohh
Monica|2| And I don’t even have a date
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Pheebs
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Do you remember where the duck food is
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, it’s in the guys’ apartment under the sink
Phoebe|5| Why
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1|  Because I’m going to London
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| What
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| What do you mean you’re going to London
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him
Rachel|1| Now honey, you take care, you don’t have those babies until I get back
Rachel|1|  
Phoebe|5| I—Rachel, you can’t go
Phoebe|5| Ross loves Emily
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does
Rachel|1| But I have to tell him how I feel
Rachel|1| He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| That’s not why you’re going
Phoebe|5|" You’re going because you hope he’s gonna say, ""Yeah, I love you too, Rach"
Phoebe|5| Forget that British chippy
Phoebe|5|""""
Rachel|1| Ohh—Do you think he will
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5| Because he’s in love with the British chippy
Phoebe|5| Look, Rachel, if you go, you’re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding
Phoebe|5| Y’know, it’s too late
Phoebe|5| You missed you’re chance
Phoebe|5| I’m sorry, I know this must be really hard, it’s over
Phoebe|5|
