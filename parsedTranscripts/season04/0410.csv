Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth
Phoebe|5| 
Ross|6| 15
Ross|6|  Your personal best
Ross|6| 
Phoebe|5| Where were you
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Oh, on a date
Ross|6| Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Oh, yeah
Chandler|4| How did you meet her
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Oh, which museum
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|  No, answer his
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars
Ross|6| She was totally at my mercy
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Were you so late because you were burring this woman
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie
Ross|6| She seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie
Chandler|4|  That joke would’ve killed in Albany
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Done
Joey|3| I did it
Joey|3| Heh, who’s stupid now
Joey|3| 
Chandler|4| Hey, look at this
Chandler|4|  They’re lighting the big Christmas tree tonight
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Umm, that paper’s two weeks old
Phoebe|5| 
Chandler|4| All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with
Rachel|1| I hate being alone this time of year
Rachel|1| Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day, then my birthday, then bang
Rachel|1|—before you know it, they’re lighting that damn tree again
Rachel|1| Ohh, I want somebody
Rachel|1|  Y’know, I want a man
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|  I mean, it doesn’t even have to be a big relationship, y’know, just like a fling would be great
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Really
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Well, I know what I’m giving you for Christmas
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Y’know what
Chandler|4| There’s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1| Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve been single
Rachel|1| How come you never offered this before
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy
Chandler|4| So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1| No accountants
Rachel|1| Oh, and no one from like legal
Rachel|1| I don’t like guys with boring jobs
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Oh and Ross was like what
Chandler|4| A lion tamer
Chandler|4|
All|0| Hey
All|0|
Phoebe|5| What’s wrong Mon
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this  on my chef’s hat
Monica|2| 
Phoebe|5| Hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘Quiet, bitch
Phoebe|5|’
Rachel|1| Hey, honey
Rachel|1| What’s the matter
Rachel|1|  Fine, I was just trying to be nice
Rachel|1| Whoa
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me
Monica|2| 
Joey|3| Ohhh
Joey|3|
Monica|2| I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would
Monica|2| But this is something I’ve been waiting for my whole life
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Well, wait a minute, you’re the boss
Rachel|1| Why don’t you just yell at them
Rachel|1| Or, fire them
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| I would love too, but I can’t
Monica|2| I mean I just can’t, you know that I’m not good at confrontation
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Hey, you know what you can do
Chandler|4| I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody
Chandler|4| Then they would all know, who’s boss
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Hey, Mon
Joey|3| I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me
Joey|3|
Monica|2| That’s a good idea
Monica|2| Wait, do you know how to waiter
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Good enough to get fired
Joey|3|
Monica|2| All right, you’re hired
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3| That must be why I got fired last week
Joey|3| Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials
Joey|3|
Chandler|4|  Yes
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| I say, Drew
Chandler|4| Are you seeing anybody right now
Chandler|4|  Og-ee-op, I’m not asking for me, I’m… I mean… No, I’m-I’m not gay, I’m not asking you out
Chandler|4| I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay
Chandler|4|
Drew|0| I didn’t think you were gay
Drew|0| I do now
Drew|0|
Chandler|4| See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up
Chandler|4|
Drew|0| Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I’m not looking for any thing serious
Drew|0|
Chandler|4| Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel
Chandler|4|
Mike|0| Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Mike|0| Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel
Mike|0|
Chandler|4|  Oh, by the way, that is her full name
Chandler|4|
Mike|0| Oh wow
Mike|0| I’m free for her
Mike|0|
Drew|0| Oh, wait a second
Drew|0| I didn’t say I wasn’t free
Drew|0|
Mike|0| Hey, Chandler, why don’t we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow
Mike|0|
Drew|0| Hold on, y’know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five
Drew|0|
Chandler|4| Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure
Chandler|4|
Mike|0| Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens
Mike|0|
Chandler|4| Well, I don’t really know what that is, but let’s
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|

Ross|6| Oh, wow
Ross|6| I should get going
Ross|6| I-I got a date tonight
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Oh yeah
Chandler|4| With who
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Yeah
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Not her
Ross|6| Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide between the two of them
Ross|6| Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun
Ross|6| But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown
Ross|6| Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s not fun
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know
Ross|6| She lives so close
Ross|6| And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny
Ross|6| On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist
Ross|6|
Joey|3|  Hey
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Hey
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Hey, man
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Hey
Phoebe|5| Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant

Monica|2| I’m gonna call a meeting tonight, I’m gonna fire you tonight
Monica|2|
Joey|3| You got it
Joey|3| Oh-oh
Joey|3| 
Monica|2| What are you doing
Monica|2|
Monica|2|

Monica|2|
Rachel|1|  Chandler
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| You have the best taste in men
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Well, like father, like son
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Patrick and I had such a great time last night
Rachel|1| I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Really
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious
Chandler|4| I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Well, y'know, possibly
Rachel|1|  You didn’t tell him that, though
Rachel|1| Right
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Ummmmmmmm, no
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| You told this guy that I was looking for a fling
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| You don’t tell the guy that
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Why not
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first date—oh, he’s so gonna get the wrong idea
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3| Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey
Joey|3| Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname
Joey|3|
A Waiter|0|  Hey, dragon
A Waiter|0| Here’s your tips from Monday and Tuesday
A Waiter|0| 
Joey|3|  There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks in this one
Joey|3|
The Waiter|0| Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays
The Waiter|0| And it never hurts to wear tight trousers
The Waiter|0|
Monica|2| Okay
Monica|2| Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials
Monica|2| Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down
Monica|2|
The Waiter|0| Because we can remember them
The Waiter|0|
Monica|2| Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night
Monica|2|
The Waiter|0| Well, sure, that too
The Waiter|0|
Monica|2| Okay, forget the specials for a minute
Monica|2| Umm, all right here’s the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm,  tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere…
The Waiter|0| Can’t hear you
The Waiter|0|
Monica|2|  A positive atmosphere
Monica|2| But I-I-I have had it up to here
Monica|2|  From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway
Monica|2| All right
Monica|2| Does anybody have a problem with that
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Monica|2|  Hey new guy
Monica|2| I said, does anybody have a problem with that
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Joey|3| No ma’am
Joey|3|
The Waiter|0| Hey
The Waiter|0| He has a name, it’s Dragon
The Waiter|0| Do you wanna know your name
The Waiter|0| Check your hat
The Waiter|0|  We did the hat right
The Waiter|0| 
Monica|2| What the hell happened
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Joey|3| I am so-so-so sorry
Joey|3| I was gonna do it
Joey|3| Really
Joey|3|" But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, ""Wow"
Joey|3| It’s been a long time since I had…  327 + 238 dollars
Joey|3|""""
Monica|2| Joey, we had a deal
Monica|2| That-that’s why you’re here
Monica|2| I’ve got to fire you
Monica|2|
Joey|3| And I gotta pay rent
Joey|3| Look, how-how about this
Joey|3| You don’t fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nice things I’ve been saying about you
Joey|3|
Monica|2| What kinda things have you been saying
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5|  Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica
Phoebe|5| Very merry…
Chandler|4|  Oh, y’know, y’know what Pheebs

Phoebe|5| So
Phoebe|5| Ross doesn’t really decorate his tree with floss, but you don’t hear him complaining do you
Phoebe|5| God
Phoebe|5| 
Chandler|4| Bad dream
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| I wasn’t sleeping
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe’s song about
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| The one with the cat
Ross|6| I gotta go, I’ve got another date
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| So, did you pick one yet
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke
Ross|6| But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny
Ross|6| So I’m still torn
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown and you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5| You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown
Phoebe|5| And then by the time you get home tonight, you’re done
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Y’know, you’re right
Ross|6| Thank you
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Prague
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| There’s sooo much you don’t know
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Chandler
Rachel|1| Patrick just uh, ended things with me
Rachel|1| Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| I did
Chandler|4| I absolutely did
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| You idiot
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| I’m sure you’re right, but why
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious relationship
Rachel|1| You don’t tell the guy that
Rachel|1| Now you scared him away
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Oh, man
Chandler|4| I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to people
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| I know
Chandler|4| I know
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Oh
Rachel|1| See just I’m right back where I started
Rachel|1| Aww, this sucks
Rachel|1| Being alone, sucks
Rachel|1| 
Chandler|4| Well, y’know, you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody
Chandler|4| You’re a great catch
Chandler|4| Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn’t have to lie once
Chandler|4| 
Rachel|1| Really
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Yeah
Chandler|4| You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| No
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Oh, it doesn’t matter
Chandler|4|  Hey, y’know what, I’ve got two tickets to tonight’s Rangers game, you wanna come with me
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Cute guys in little shorts
Rachel|1| Sure
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Well, actually it’s a hockey team, so it’s angry Canadians with no teeth
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Well that sounds fun too
Rachel|1| 
Chandler|4| Have you ever been with a woman
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| Chandler, what is the matter with you
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
