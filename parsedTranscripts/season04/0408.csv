Chandler|4| Aww, giving thanks
Chandler|4| Aww
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Look everyone, it’s the spirit of Thanksgiving
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| So are things with you and Joey any better
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| They couldn’t be worse
Chandler|4| I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Oh wow, eight hours
Rachel|1| So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| You shouldn’t
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift
Phoebe|5| And-and there’s the added mystery of who gets who
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Who gets whom
Ross|6|  I don’t know why I do that
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Well, I’m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| We haven’t eaten yet
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just… 
Chandler|4| Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, ‘cause I wanna trade for her
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| I picked her
Phoebe|5| Oh thank God you want her
Phoebe|5| Ooh
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Wow
Chandler|4| Why do you want to get rid of her so badly
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it’s like impossible to get her something she likes
Phoebe|5| Come on, let’s trade
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Oh that’s not true
Chandler|4| That’s not true
Chandler|4| I got her that backpack and she loved it
Chandler|4| I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it…  Oh, there was no big dog
Chandler|4| All right this sucks
Chandler|4| I already got her this briefcase, and I had R
Chandler|4|G
Chandler|4| put on it…  Her initials…
Phoebe|5| Ohh
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Well, maybe you could give to somebody else
Monica|2| Ooh, like Ross Geller
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Op, y'know what though, it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Who cares
Monica|2| He works in a museum
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Hey, what time is it
Chandler|4| The big game is about to start
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| You don’t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren’t here, you can watch the parade if you want
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Thanks
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| What is wrong with this freezer
Monica|2|
Monica|2|  Ow
Monica|2| Ow
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| God, what happened
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Oh my God, ice just got in my eye
Monica|2|
Rachel|1|  People are trying to sleep in here
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Open it up, let me see
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Oh, y’know what, I can’t, it really kills
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Well maybe you should put some ice on it
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Ooh, God it looks bad
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| No, my eye doctor is Richard
Monica|2| I can’t go to him when I don’t have a boyfriend
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| He’s really picky about his patients
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Honey, you’ve got to go
Phoebe|5| What’s his office number
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Like I remember his office number
Monica|2|  Speed dial 7
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5|  Hi
Phoebe|5| Yeah, I’m calling on behalf of Monica Geller’s eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today
Phoebe|5|   He’s out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Yes
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Yes
Phoebe|5| She’s very excited about that
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| This is so cool, ‘til Monica gets back, it’s like I’m head chef and I get to make all the decisions
Phoebe|5| 
Ross|6| Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Okay, get out of my kitchen
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4|  All right
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once
Chandler|4|  I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Really
Ross|6|
Ross|6| Wow
Ross|6| That’s-that’s so nice, what are you gonna get me
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| I don’t know R
Chandler|4|G
Chandler|4|, I was thinking something girlie for your office
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Oh, that’s not true
Ross|6| I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Like
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| When was the last time you saw her wear it
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh…
Chandler|4| Big dog
Chandler|4|
Ross|6|  Hey
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3|
Ross|6| What are you doing
Ross|6|
Joey|3| I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Everything
Ross|6| Even the TV
Ross|6|
Joey|3| No
Joey|3| I’m putting that in my room
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out
Joey|3|
Ross|6| That’s a good point
Ross|6| So uh, how long are you gonna punish him
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Five years
Joey|3| 
Ross|6| You’ve sentenced him
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3| Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Joey, the guy’s your best friend
Ross|6|
Joey|3| No, was my best friend
Joey|3| Anyway, I don’t know why you’re pushing for him so hard
Joey|3| With him out of the way as my best friend, there’s a spot open
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Oh, who
Ross|6| Me
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Wow
Ross|6| I’m honored
Ross|6| And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend
Ross|6|
Joey|3| What
Joey|3|
Ross|6| I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler
Ross|6|
Joey|3| All right
Joey|3| But if you weren’t my best friend
Joey|3|
Kathy|0| Oh my God, is it really that bad
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian
Chandler|4| And I know he only knows the bad words
Chandler|4|
Joey|3|  Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler
Joey|3|
Gunther|0| I thought you were Chandler
Gunther|0| But umm, one of who is over there
Gunther|0|
Kathy|0| Oh

Rachel|1|
Nurse|0| Dr
Nurse|0| Burke will see you know
Nurse|0|
Monica|2| Oh no-no-no, not Dr
Monica|2| Burke
Monica|2| Dr

Chandler|4| Hey
Chandler|4| I’m sorry
Chandler|4| That— where are you going
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| My folks
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| I don’t know
Joey|3| I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| What
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah, y’know at first I thought we could talk about this y’know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don’t think I…
Chandler|4| Hey, look, what do you want me to say
Chandler|4| Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Look, it’s not about her
Joey|3| Okay
Joey|3| But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did
Joey|3| And I don’t want to live with some one who doesn’t know what it is to be a friend
Joey|3| So, I’ll see ya
Joey|3| 
Chandler|4| Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3| You did
Joey|3| And that’s why I’m leaving
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them
Chandler|4| Okay, they have had a very difficult year
Chandler|4| What with the robbery and all
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time
Joey|3| I was thinking about how I let you down
Joey|3| 
Chandler|4| What
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3| But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much
Joey|3| See you around
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| All right, wait
Chandler|4| Come on
Chandler|4| Just wait one second
Chandler|4| There has to be something that I can do
Chandler|4| Something
Chandler|4| If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down
Chandler|4|  What
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| We’ve got a box
Joey|3| 
Tim|0| Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college
Tim|0| And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen
Tim|0|
Monica|2| I was probably waiting for it to open
Monica|2|
Tim|0| I gotta tell you, you look great now
Tim|0|
Monica|2| You look great too
Monica|2|
Tim|0| You’re an excellent patient
Tim|0|
Monica|2| So how does it look
Monica|2|
Tim|0| Well, you’ve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days
Tim|0|
Monica|2| Like a pirate
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Tim|0| If that helps you
Tim|0| 
Monica|2| Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad
Monica|2|  Come on, one of us had to mention him
Monica|2|
Tim|0| I moved back here a couple of months ago
Tim|0|
Monica|2| Oh
Monica|2| Big family dinner tonight
Monica|2|
Tim|0| Uh
Tim|0| 
Monica|2| No way
Monica|2|
Tim|0| I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend’s
Tim|0|
Monica|2|  Oh
Monica|2|
Tim|0| But we broke up
Tim|0|
Monica|2|  Oh
Monica|2| 
Tim|0| She-she wasn’t ready for a serious commitment
Tim|0|
Monica|2|  Oh
Monica|2|  So you made her walk the plank
Monica|2| Aye, matie
Monica|2|
Tim|0| You’re not wearing the patch yet
Tim|0|
Monica|2| I know
Monica|2|
Ross|6| He’s coming here for Thanksgiving
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| I know, it’s sick
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Why is it sick
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Because it’s Richard’s son
Rachel|1| It’s like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don’t you
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, I can see where I’d be your best shot but, no
Phoebe|5| I’m sorry, but I think it’s twisted
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Yeah
Ross|6|
Joey|3|  What’s twisted
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Me going out with Richard’s son
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Ewwwww
Joey|3|
Joey|3| Ew
Joey|3| Ew
Joey|3| Ew
Joey|3|
Chandler|4|  Sounds like a really bad idea to me
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Is he okay in there
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| He’s fine
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son, you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Fine
Monica|2| Judge all you want to but,  married a lesbian,  left a man at the altar,  fell in love with a gay ice dancer,  threw a girl’s wooden leg in a fire,  livin’ in a box
Monica|2|
Monica|2| 
Rachel|1| So now, what exactly is the point of the box
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Chandler
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| The meaning of the box is three fold
Chandler|4| One , it gives me the time to think about what I did
Chandler|4| Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey
Chandler|4| And three , it hurts
Chandler|4|
Ross|6|  Oh hey
Ross|6| Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year
Ross|6| Can I see it
Ross|6|
Rachel|1|  Why
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| I just wanna check something
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1| 
Ross|6|   Now, we’ll see
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Air hole
Chandler|4| Air hole
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| 
Rachel|1|  Here it is
Rachel|1| I love it
Rachel|1| I wear it all the time
Rachel|1|
Ross|6|  The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed
Rachel|1| 
Ross|6| Oh my God
Ross|6| You actually exchanged it
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| What did you get
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Credit
Rachel|1| 
Monica|2|  I’ll get it
Monica|2| I’ll get it
Monica|2| I’ll get it
Monica|2| I’ll get it

Ross|6|
Rachel|1| 
Monica|2| All right everybody, this turkey is ready
Monica|2|
Tim|0| Where can I wash up
Tim|0|
Monica|2| Here, let me show you
Monica|2| Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap
Monica|2|
Tim|0| Thank you
Tim|0|
Rachel|1| Fancy soap
Rachel|1| I thought we were savin’ that for the Pope
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| See he’s nice
Monica|2| Right
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5|" Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, ""That’s not how your dad used to do it"
Phoebe|5|""""
Tim|0| Wow
Tim|0| Everything looks great
Tim|0| Where should I sit
Tim|0|
Monica|2| I saved you a seat
Monica|2| 
Rachel|1|  Sick-sick-sick-sick
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Oh, I’ll get it
Phoebe|5| 
Chandler|4| Gotcha
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3| That doesn’t sound like thinking to me
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Sorry
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Y’know I don’t think you should be talking at all in there
Joey|3| I think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Okay, okay, you got it
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Ross, can you pass me the yams
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Sure
Ross|6| Oh, and Joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Would you stop
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| What is the matter with you
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Oh-ho-ho, we’ve got company
Monica|2|
Ross|6| There’s nothing the matter with me
Ross|6| See, I’m not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Okay, fine
Rachel|1| 
Chandler|4| You can’t tell, but I’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| All right, look
Joey|3| If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right
Joey|3|
Joey|3| This means something to me
Joey|3| And if it doesn’t mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you’re just an idiot in a box
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| You’re right, and I’m sorry
Chandler|4| This means a lot to me
Chandler|4| I want you to be my friend again
Chandler|4| I swear, I won’t say another word tonight
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Absolutely
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| That sounds like another word to me
Joey|3| Are you gonna take this seriously
Joey|3|  Okay
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Don’t say that I have no sentiment
Rachel|1|  This is a movie stub from our first date
Rachel|1| This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed
Rachel|1|  This is from the museum from the first time we… were together
Rachel|1| Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter
Rachel|1| 
Ross|6| I don’t know what to say, I’m sorry
Ross|6| Though, you’re not supposed to take these
Ross|6|  It’s like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that
Ross|6|
Monica|2|  Ooh, this always happens
Monica|2| 
Tim|0| Here, let me help
Tim|0| 
Monica|2| Thank you
Monica|2|
Tim|0| You-you have a very beautiful… eye
Tim|0|
Monica|2| Y’know all my friends think this is weird
Monica|2| 
Tim|0| Y’know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn’t
Tim|0|
Monica|2| I know
Monica|2| I mean it’s like me and your dad, that’s a totally separate thing
Monica|2|
Tim|0| Oh, I totally agree
Tim|0|
Monica|2| We’re just two people who find each other very attractive
Monica|2| Right
Monica|2|
Tim|0| What
Tim|0|
Monica|2| Nothing
Monica|2| Nothing
Monica|2|
Tim|0| No-no really, was-was that not okay
Tim|0|
Monica|2| No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss…
Tim|0| Oh my God
Tim|0| It didn’t remind you of…
Monica|2|  Don’t say it
Monica|2|
Tim|0| No, but it did
Tim|0| Didn’t it
Tim|0|
Tim|0|
Monica|2| Yeah
Monica|2|
Tim|0| Oh man

Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3|
Kathy|0| Hey
Kathy|0| Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am…
Joey|3| That’s okay
Joey|3| Chandler’s the one I’m mad at
Joey|3|
Kathy|0| Well, I’m still sorry
Kathy|0| Is he here
Kathy|0|
Joey|3| In the box
Joey|3|
Kathy|0|  Chandler
Kathy|0|
Phoebe|5| Oh, he-he can’t talk right now
Phoebe|5|
Kathy|0| Why not
Kathy|0| What’s going on
Kathy|0|
Phoebe|5| He’s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him
Phoebe|5|
Kathy|0| By being in a box
Kathy|0|
Rachel|1| Joey, had reasons
Rachel|1| 
Phoebe|5| They were threefold
Phoebe|5|
Kathy|0| Oh
Kathy|0| Well uh,  you not being able to talk may make this easier
Kathy|0| Listen umm…  Listen I don’t wanna be someone who comes between two best friends
Kathy|0| I just, I can’t stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don’t wanna be the cause of that
Kathy|0| So, I don’t think we can see each other anymore
Kathy|0| I’m gonna go to my mom’s in Chicago, I’m gonna stay there for awhile
Kathy|0| I think this could’ve be something really amazing, but y’know this is probably for the best
Kathy|0| Y’know
Kathy|0| I’m gonna miss you
Kathy|0| Good-bye, Chandler
Kathy|0| 
Joey|3|  Open the box
Joey|3|
Joey|3| 
Rachel|1| What
