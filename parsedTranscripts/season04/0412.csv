Phoebe|Phoebe| Hey!
Ross|Ross| Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
Rachel|Rachel| Well, I’ve been up since six. Thanks to somebody’s dumb-ass rooster.
Phoebe|Phoebe| You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn’t be living in an apartment.
Rachel|Rachel| Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…
Phoebe|Phoebe| All right. I’m gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I’m ready to have Frank and Alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.
Ross|Ross| Now, how will they know if you’re ready?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, they’re just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.

Dr. Zane|Other| Okay, it’ll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
Phoebe|Phoebe|" Embryossss? As in, ""More than one?"""
Dr. Zane|Other| Um-hmm, five actually.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
Dr. Zane|Other| We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
Phoebe|Phoebe| That’s it! 25 percent? That means that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
Frank|Other| Hey, y’know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
Alice|Other| Sweety, now, she’s a woman, not a gumball machine.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Okay, well y’know what, don’t worry you guys, ‘cause I’m-I’m gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Frank|Other| Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
Alice|Other| Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we’re kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Whoa!! That—okay, that’s a lot of pressure on me and my uterus.  So, well okay, so is there—is maybe is there something that I can do y’know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
Dr. Zane|Other| No, I’m sorry.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Wow! You guys really don’t know anything!
