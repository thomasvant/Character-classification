Chandler|4|
Rachel|1|  Well, I just called Joshua…
Phoebe|5| Oh, how did it go
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| What did he say
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding
Rachel|1| Ugh
Rachel|1| I feel blue
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Ohh, sweetie
Monica|2|  Hey, I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care
Rachel|1| I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about
Rachel|1| Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, maybe
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| And I-I am just trying to figure out why
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Any luck
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again
Rachel|1| I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Again
Monica|2| Y’know what
Monica|2| I think we all did
Monica|2|
Ross|6|  Hey
Ross|6|
