Phoebe|5| Oh my God
Phoebe|5| I can’t believe my little brother is married
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0| Oh I know
Frank|0|
Frank|0| 
Phoebe|5| You guys, why didn’t you tell me you were eloping
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0| ‘Cause it just sorta happened, y’know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch…
Phoebe|5| Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse
Phoebe|5| 
Frank|0| We were having lunch
Frank|0|" Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, ""Hey"
Frank|0| Y'know, we’re here, having lunch let’s get married
Frank|0|
Phoebe|5| Wow, a year and a half ago I didn’t even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too
Phoebe|5|  Okay
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5| Stop it, don’t
Phoebe|5| So, I gotta get you a gift now
Phoebe|5| Is there anything you need
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0| Uhh, yeah
Frank|0|
Alice|0| We’ve been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought we’d get a jump on things, y’know no one’s getting any younger
Alice|0|
Frank|0| See the thing is umm, we’re not able to y’know, uh, conceive
Frank|0|
Alice|0| And we’ve tried everything, we’ve seen a bunch of doctors
Alice|0|
Frank|0| Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl
Frank|0| So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into
Frank|0|
Phoebe|5|  That’s a really nice gift
Phoebe|5| I was thinking of like a gravy boat
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3|  Hey
Joey|3| You guys
Joey|3| Check it out, check it out
Joey|3|  Guess which job I got
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| I don’t know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| What
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Blue blazer back
Chandler|4| He-he wants it back
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| But you-you said black
Rachel|1| Why would he want his blue blazer black
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Well, you-you know what I meant
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| No, you messed it up
Monica|2| You’re stupid
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| So what job did you get Joe
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum
Joey|3| Yeah, Ross got it for me
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Well, how can you be a tour guide, don’t you have to be a dinosaur expert or something
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| No, not really
Joey|3| They give you all the information, it’s uh, it’s like memorizing a script
Joey|3|"  ""And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period"
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Great
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| That’s great
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Great
Monica|2|
Monica|2| That’s great
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Great
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| That’s great
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Uh actually Joey, it’s the Cretasous period
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5|  Hey
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
All|0| Hey
All|0|
Phoebe|5| Guess what
Phoebe|5| Frank Jr
Phoebe|5|, and Alice got married
Phoebe|5|
All|0| Oh my God
All|0|
All|0|
Phoebe|5| And
Phoebe|5| And, they’re gonna have a baby
Phoebe|5|  And
Phoebe|5| And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus
Phoebe|5| 
Ross|6| My God
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Are you serious
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Joey|3| You’re really thinking about having sex with your brother
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Ewww
Phoebe|5|" And ""Oh no"
Phoebe|5|""" It’s—they just want me to be the surrogate"
Phoebe|5| It’s her-it’s her egg and her sperm, and I’m-I’m just the oven, it’s totally their bun
Phoebe|5| 
Joey|3| Huh
Joey|3|
Monica|2| What did you tell them
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about
Phoebe|5| I’m gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| You’re gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Yeah, like you’re gonna be pregnant
Monica|2| I mean pregnant
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| I know
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Pheebs, you’re talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it’s all for somebody else
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, what’s your point
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Well, the stuff I just mentioned
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Wow
Rachel|1| I don’t know if I could ever do that
Rachel|1| I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be a…keeper
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we’ll be supportive like crazy
Joey|3|
All|0| Yeah
All|0|
Monica|2| We just want you to think it through
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who’s had a baby
Rachel|1| Like your mom
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| My mom never gave birth
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5| But my birth mom did
Phoebe|5|
Kathy|0| Umm,  I love this touchy
Kathy|0| Can I take it to work with me
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| Oh, yeah, sure, it’s not mine anyway
Chandler|4| It can with the pants
Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| Oh
Kathy|0| 
Monica|2| I am so jealous
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| You guys are really right…there aren’t you
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Yes
Chandler|4| Right where
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| In the beginning where y’know it’s all sex and talking and sex and talking and…
Chandler|4| Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| And the sex
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| All right, we haven’t had sex yet
Chandler|4| Okay, what’s the big deal
Chandler|4| Y’know
Chandler|4| This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Oh, Chandler that is so nice
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| That is really nice…lying
Ross|6| No way is that the reason
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Why
Rachel|1| Just because you’re not mature enough to understand something like that
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| No, he’s right, I’m totally lying
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Then what is it
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Well, Kathy’s last boyfriend was Joey
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| And you’re afraid you won’t be able to…fill his shoes
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| No, I’m afraid I won’t be able to make love as well as him
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Yeah, I was going for the metaphor
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Yes, and I was saying the actual words
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| So big deal, so Joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’t mean he’s great in bed
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| We share a wall
Chandler|4| So either he’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Sweetie, with you it’s gonna be different
Monica|2| The sex is gonna be great, ‘cause you-you guys are in love
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Just go for it Chandler
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Yeah, you should
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Yeah, you should, really
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Go on
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| All right, all right, I’ll go sleep with my girlfriend
Chandler|4| But I’m just doing it for you guys
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period
Joey|3|
Smart Kid|0| Isn’t the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic
Smart Kid|0|
Joey|3| Shhh
Joey|3| This is a museum, no talking
Joey|3| Right down here,  we have a large foot
Joey|3|  Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller
Joey|3|  Everyone wave ‘Hi’ to Ross
Joey|3| Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work
Joey|3|  Okay, moving right along
Joey|3| Come on
Joey|3|
Phoebe Sr|0| It’s open
Phoebe Sr|0| Come in
Phoebe Sr|0|
Phoebe|5| Hi
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe Sr|0| Hi
Phoebe Sr|0|
Phoebe|5| I’m sorry, I’m late
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe Sr|0| Oh, that’s okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples
Phoebe Sr|0|
Phoebe|5| Wow
Phoebe|5| You really go all out when you’re expecting company
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe Sr|0| No, I was working on my pottery
Phoebe Sr|0|
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5| Ooh
Phoebe|5| Oh, I didn’t know that you did…pot
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe Sr|0| Well, yeah, mostly nudes
Phoebe Sr|0| It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica
Phoebe Sr|0|
Phoebe|5| Ooh, erotiery
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe Sr|0| Hey
Phoebe Sr|0| Okay
Phoebe Sr|0| Well thanks for coming out to see me
Phoebe Sr|0| I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person
Phoebe Sr|0| Y’know…
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe Sr|0| I really don’t think it’s a very good idea, Phoebe
Phoebe Sr|0|
Phoebe|5| Why not
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe Sr|0| Well, because you’d be giving up a baby, and I-I really don’t—I don’t know if there’s anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby
Phoebe Sr|0| So, umm, 
Phoebe|5| Oh no
Phoebe|5| No-no
Phoebe|5| I understand the pain
Phoebe|5| Don’t-don’t hurt the puppy
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe Sr|0| No-no-no, the-the puppy’s yours
Phoebe Sr|0|
Phoebe|5| Oh, I get a puppy
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe Sr|0| Well, yeah
Phoebe Sr|0| I mean yeah, but only for three days
Phoebe Sr|0|
Phoebe|5| Why
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe Sr|0| I realise I don’t have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm,  uhh… Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it’s very important
Phoebe Sr|0| 
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe Sr|0| I mean, I know what I’m talking about
Phoebe Sr|0| I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies
Phoebe Sr|0| I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life
Phoebe Sr|0| So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child
Phoebe Sr|0|  I really shouldn’t have given you the puppy first
Phoebe Sr|0|
Phoebe|5| All right, I’m sorry
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Uhh, do you mind sitting there
Joey|3| I’m-I’m saving this for my friend Ross
Joey|3|
Tour Guide|0| You mean Dr
Tour Guide|0| Geller
Tour Guide|0|
Joey|3| Doctor
Joey|3| Wow
Joey|3| I didn’t know he had a nickname
Joey|3|
Tour Guide|0| Oh, he won’t sit here
Tour Guide|0| Only the people in the white coats sit over there,  and only the people in the blue blazers sit here
Tour Guide|0|
Joey|3| Well, how-how come
Joey|3|
Tour Guide|0| That’s just the way it is
Tour Guide|0|
Joey|3| That’s crazy
Joey|3|
Tour Guide|0| Maybe it’s crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now
Tour Guide|0| See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now… Peter
Tour Guide|0| Hey, Peter
Tour Guide|0| It’s me Rhonda
Tour Guide|0| From PS-129
Tour Guide|0| I shared my puddin’ which you man
Tour Guide|0| I gave you my Snack Pack
Tour Guide|0|  See, he pretend he don’t even here me
Tour Guide|0|
Joey|3| I-I think everybody’s pretending they don’t hear you
Joey|3| Anyway, look, I don’t know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, I’m telling you, he will sit in it
Joey|3|  Ross
Joey|3| Ross
Joey|3| Over here, man
Joey|3| I-I saved you seat
Joey|3|
Ross|6| That’s okay, I’m cool over here
Ross|6| I’ll catch up with you later, Joey
Ross|6| 
Tour Guide|0| Op, this is saved
Tour Guide|0|  Gift shop
Tour Guide|0|
Ross|6|  Hey, uh, I’m really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today
Ross|6|
Joey|3| It’s no big deal
Joey|3| Hey, y’know, you do what you gotta do
Joey|3| Right
Joey|3|
Ross|6| But hey, it’s not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Whatever
Joey|3|
Ross|6| It’s like that everywhere, Joey
Ross|6| Okay, Mon, back me up here
Ross|6| Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right
Ross|6| And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right
Ross|6|
Monica|2| I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Look, Ross, really it’s-it’s no big deal
Joey|3| Y’know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can’t be friends at work, then so be it
Joey|3| Y’know, hey I understand
Joey|3| Y’know
Joey|3| Hey, when I’m in a play and you’re in the audience, I don’t talk to you, right
Joey|3| So it’s y’know, it’s uh, it’s cool
Joey|3| I’ll see you tomorrow
Joey|3| 
Rachel|1| Yeah, when we’re in the audience he doesn’t talk to us, but he does wave
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Hi
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Hey
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Ooh, y’know what, I think it’s time for puppy to go out again
Phoebe|5| Come on, let’s go to the balcony
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| What
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Umm, the street
Phoebe|5| Come on, let’s go to the street
Phoebe|5| Ooh, listen, don’t go onto the balcony until after I get back
Phoebe|5| 
Monica|2|  So, did you do it
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yes, yes, we had the sex
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Uh-oh, it was bad
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| It was fine, y’know
Chandler|4| But she didn’t agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey
Chandler|4|" She was more like, ""I see you point, I’m all right with it"
Chandler|4|""""
Monica|2| Well, it was the first time
Monica|2| Y’know, there’s not always a lot of agreement the first time
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree  like that
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Look, you have to help me
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y’know, I know where everything goes, it’s always nice
Chandler|4|" But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, ""My God"
Chandler|4| Somebody’s killing her in there
Chandler|4|""""
Monica|2| All right, I’m gonna show you something a lot of guys don’t know
Monica|2| Rach, give me that pad, please
Monica|2|  All right
Monica|2| Now…
Chandler|4| Look, you don’t have to draw an actual wo—whoa
Chandler|4| She’s hot
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones
Monica|2|  You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven
Monica|2|
Chandler|4|  There are seven
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Let me see that
Rachel|1|  Oh, yeah
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4|  That’s one
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| It’s kind of an important one
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Well, y’know, sometimes that helps
Rachel|1| 
Monica|2|  Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| That-that’s bad
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Well if you go to Disneyland, you don’t spend the whole day on the Materhorn
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Well you might if it were anything like 7
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit ‘em all, and you mix ‘em up
Monica|2| You gotta keep them on their toes
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Oo, toes
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| Well, for some people
Rachel|1| 
Monica|2| All right
Monica|2| Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4,  2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, …7

Joey|3| Geller
Joey|3| 
Ross|6| Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch
Ross|6| Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y’know what I see, I see-I see division
Ross|6|" Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, ""My God why"
Ross|6|
Ross|6|""" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath"
Ross|6|  I’m Ross
Ross|6| I’m divorced, and I have a kid
Ross|6|

Phoebe|5| My mom’s gonna be here any minute
Phoebe|5| I can’t do this, I can’t give him up
Phoebe|5| Yes—no, I can
Phoebe|5| I don’t want to
Phoebe|5| But I can
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Oo, I can’t watch this, it’s like Sophie’s Choice
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Y’know, I never saw that
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Ooh, it was only okay
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Ooh, I can’t do this
Phoebe|5| My mom was right
Phoebe|5| If I can’t-if I can’t give him up, then there’s no way I can give up a baby
Phoebe|5| Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed
Phoebe|5| What-what else, what else can I give ‘em—a kidney
Phoebe|5|
Alice|0|  Hi
Alice|0|
Frank|0| Hi
Frank|0|
Alice|0| Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so…
Frank|0| Yeah, so we just thought we’d stop by and let you know there’s still no pressure
Frank|0|
Alice|0| None
Alice|0| But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we’re just gonna be right over there  having coffee
Alice|0|
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0|  Oh, who’s this little guy
Frank|0|
Frank|0| 
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5| Ooh
Phoebe|5| Umm
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0| Oh, he’s so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour
Frank|0|
Alice|0| You are so precious, I could just take you home
Alice|0|
Phoebe|5| Hey, why don’t you
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0| Are you serious
Frank|0|
Phoebe|5| Uh-huh, yeah
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0| Oh, thanks
Frank|0|
Monica|2| What are you doing
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| No, I’m really okay with this
Phoebe|5| Y’know why
Phoebe|5| ‘Cause look at them, and I made that, so… I know it’s gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, it’s gonna feel like a million times better, right
Phoebe|5| I wanna do this
Phoebe|5|  I wanna carry your baby
Phoebe|5|
Alice|0|  Oh
Alice|0| Oh
Alice|0| Oh

Monica|2|
Phoebe Sr|0|  Hi
Phoebe Sr|0| What’s going on
Phoebe Sr|0|
Phoebe|5| Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided I’m gonna carry their baby
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe Sr|0| But Phoebe…
Phoebe|5| No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe Sr|0| Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but it’s just—that was my puppy
Phoebe Sr|0|
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5|
