Monica|2|
Ross|6| Well, I'm gonna go get ready,  for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head

Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| Not your type
Kathy|0|
Kathy|0| She's gorgeous
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| Y'know what I think it is
Chandler|4| It's the fishnet stockings
Chandler|4| Y'know
Chandler|4| Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings
Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| Okay
Kathy|0| Understanding a little more why you're single
Kathy|0| Ohh
Kathy|0| Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty

Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer

Joey|3|
Chandler|4| What
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away
Joey|3| I thought we had a deal
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Hey, look, what do you want from me
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| I want you to like her
Joey|3| But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| I am pretending
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Well then, do it better
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her
Chandler|4|  No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her
Chandler|4| That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her
Chandler|4| That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Well, that's pretty good
Joey|3| But you might wanna tone it down a little
Joey|3|
Ross|6|  Hey
Ross|6| So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off
Ross|6| Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Ross|6|uh, she's old enough to drive
Ross|6|  So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight
Ross|6|
Monica|2| No, sorry
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Well where's Amanda
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| I mean y'know, I'm thinking
Rachel|1| You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Ross, cough drops, please
Monica|2|
Ross|6| At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Why don't you just marry her
Rachel|1| Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| You see Amanda and I have a very special
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Monica|2|  You have nothing
Monica|2| You're not even going out
Monica|2| You're her baby sitter
Monica|2| You have a 12-year-old girl's job
Monica|2|
Rachel|1|  Ohh, that is soo sad
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me
Monica|2|'
Rachel|1| Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me
Rachel|1| At least he bought me something with it
Rachel|1| 
Monica|2| That's mine
Monica|2|
Monica|2| Now, would you both please start acting like adults
Monica|2| And get me my cough drops
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Fine
