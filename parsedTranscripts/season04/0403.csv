Joey| Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there. 
Chandler| Oh no-no-no, I’m, I’m paddling away!
Joey|  Huh?!
Chandler| Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Joey| Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped! 
Chandler| Could we be more white trash?
Monica|  How desperate am I?
Rachel| Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game.
Monica| I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.
Phoebe| How come?
Monica| Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
Ross| Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do.
Monica| You don’t have to stick up for her. She can’t here you.
Rachel|  Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?
Joey| Just pickle.
Chandler| Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
Rachel| My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must’ve been awkward.
Chandler| Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
Rachel|  You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you?
Chandler|  No. No!
Joanna|  Hello, Rachel. 
Chandler| Well, not at first.
Rachel| What is she doing here?
Rachel| I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’
Chandler| Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Rachel| Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Chandler| Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself.
Rachel| Chandler!!  Promise me, you will end it.
Chandler| Okay, I promise, I’ll end it.
Rachel| Thank you.
Chandler| I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
Joey| Yeah-eh-eah!  Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
Mrs. Geller|  How’s the hired help?
Monica| Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
Mrs. Geller| What’s this? Blue nail polish?
Monica| Yeah, I thought it was cute.
Mrs. Geller| Ahh, that’s what your Grandmother’s hands looked like when we found her.
Monica| Let me ask you a question.
Mrs. Geller| Hmm.
Monica| Why did you hire me?
Mrs. Geller| Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren’t sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something. 
Monica|  Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I’m good.
Phoebe| Okay, I didn’t hear that.
Monica| Oh yeah, she didn’t hire me out of pity, it wasn’t so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I’m good.
Phoebe| Wow! And hey, it’s cool if you’re a lesbian! 
The Salesman|  Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?
Joey| Uhhhh. 
The Salesman| Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias? 
Joey| No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
The Salesman| Actually, I’m not buying. I’m selling. Let me ask you one question. Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you’re not really sure what they’re talking about?
Ross| …I’m telling you it’s totally unconstituional.
Monica| Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Chandler| Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Phoebe| Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Rachel| Oh yeah, I totally agree.
Monica| …I think he deserves a Nobel Prize. 
All| Nooo!! 
Chandler| …it was like the Algonquin kids table. 
The Salesman|  Excuse me, I’m sorry, you haven’t said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?
Joey| Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
Phoebe| That’s weird.
Monica| What?
Phoebe| Your nails.
Monica| Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them.
Phoebe| Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine now.
Monica|  Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them put…  Oh my God! It’s in the quiche! Oh My God!
Phoebe| Okay, don’t panic. I’m gonna go to the store, I’m gonna get you another set of nails, no one’s gonna know, and you’re gonna look great.  Oh! Oh, it’s ‘cause they’re gonna eat—that’s the problem.
Mrs. Geller|   Honey, don’t bite your nails.
Monica| Okay ah, please don’t freak out. Umm, but ah, there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to know which one.
Phoebe| And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!
Mrs. Geller|  I’m not freaking out.
Monica| Then why are you laughing?
Mrs. Geller| It’s nothing, it’s just that now your Father owes me five dollars.
Monica| What? You bet I’d lose a nail?
Mrs. Geller| Oh no, don’t be silly. I just bet I’d need these. 
Monica| Frozen lasagnas?
Mrs. Geller| Um-hmm.
Monica| You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was…
Mrs. Geller| No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
Monica| You promised Dr. Weinburg, you’d never use that phrase.
Mrs. Geller| Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you’ve never been able to laugh at yourself.
Monica|  That’s right. My Mom doesn’t have any faith in me! Oh, that’s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Phoebe| I don’t get it.
Mrs. Geller| No, I have faith…
Monica|  No! You have lasagnas! 
Oven| Ding!
Phoebe| Op, the ruined quiches are ready.
Chandler| It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up.
Joanna| No, we are. I’m sad.
Chandler| Okay.
Joanna|  Yes.  Uh, can’t you wait until tomorrow?  All right.  Unbelievable!!
Chandler| Thanks.
Joanna| No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.
Chandler| Okay. 
Joanna| What are you doing?
Chandler| I’m getting dressed.
Joanna| Why?
Chandler| When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
Joanna| Wait. I wanna show you something.
Chandler| What is it?
Joanna| Just a little gag gift somebody gave me.  Put your hands together.
Chandler| Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me.  Yeah, you are!  Ooh, saucy.
Joanna|  I’ll be back in ten minutes. 
Chandler| You are, you’re gonna leave me like this?
Joanna| Knowing you’re here, waiting for me I think it’s kinda exciting.
Chandler| Okay. But if you don’t come back soon,  there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it!
Joanna|  Oh.
Sophie| Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
Joanna| Oh great! I’ll keep it in my butt with your nose. 
Rachel| That’s weird, she locked the door.
Sophie| Y’know why? She’s got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
Rachel| Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list?
Sophie| Yeah!
Chandler| Hi!  How are you?
Chandler| Hello, Joanna……’s office.
Joanna|  I’m really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
Chandler| How little?!
Joanna| A couple of hours, I feel awful.
Chandler| Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!
Joanna| I can’t!!
Chandler| Why not?!
Joanna| I’m in my boss’s car!
Chandler| What?!
Joanna| Uh-oh, tunnel. 
Rachel|   What?!
Chandler|  Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
Chandler| Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
Rachel| You promised you would break up with her!
Chandler| I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
Rachel| And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
Chandler| It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
Rachel| Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
Chandler| No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and 
Rachel| Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it!  You never see Joanna again!
Chandler| Never!
Rachel| You never come into this office again!
Chandler| Fine!
Rachel| You give me back my Walkman!
Chandler| I—never borrowed your Walkman.
Rachel| Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
Chandler| You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great!  Ahhh! 
Rachel| Does it hurt?
Chandler| No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them.  Hello sweet pants!
Rachel| Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
Chandler| About what?
Rachel| When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired!
Chandler| I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
Rachel| No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were! 
Chandler| Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so!
Chandler| Well, this is much better.
The Salesman| So, here’s somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?
Joey| He cut off his ear.
The Salesman| And?
Joey| I’m out.
The Salesman| He painted that. 
Joey| Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
The Salesman| Let’s see, ahhh… Where does the Pope live?
Joey| In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer.
The Salesman| Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?
Joey| Spock’s birth control.
The Salesman|  You need these books.
Phoebe| Hey!
Monica| Hi.
Phoebe| This used to be your room?  Wow! You must’ve been in really good shape as a kid.
Monica| Ohh, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually thought she could change.
Phoebe| Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.
Monica| Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on.
Phoebe| No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica.
Monica| What?
Phoebe|" Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, ""Yeah, he pulled a Monica."" Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, ""Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica."" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, ""Yeah, that one’s outta here."" Though some things don’t change."
Monica|  All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make.
Phoebe| Wow! My breasts are really strong. 
Rachel| Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office. Now I know why.
Chandler| Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
Rachel| What if I clean your bathroom for a month?
Chandler| It still wouldn’t be clean.  All I want is my freedom.
Rachel| Foot rubs for a month!
Chandler| Freedom!
Rachel| I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!
Chandler| Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?!  Sophie, help me! Help me!! 
Rachel| Sophie sit!!
Rachel| No! God, would you just calm down!
Chandler| I’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just… 
Joey| Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit.   In a minute. 
The Salesman| So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
Joey| Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’.
The Salesman| Well ah, what can you swing?
Joey| How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
The Salesman| You don’t have, anything?
Joey| You wanna see what I got?  Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!
The Salesman| Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time. 
Joey| And a 50.  Huh, these must be Chandler’s pants.
The Salesman| For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?
Joey| Oh, I-I think I’m gonna stick with the V, I wanna see how this bad boy turns out.
Rachel| I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.
Chandler| No!
Rachel| I ah… Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
Chandler| With extra pulp?
Rachel|  Yeah!!
Chandler| No!
Rachel| D’oh!!  I’ve got it!
Chandler| You don’t have it.
Rachel| I have so got it. There’s gonna be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
Chandler| How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Rachel| Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous  or very  stingy.
Chandler|  Go on.
Rachel| I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle.
Chandler| And Milton Berle has a…
Rachel| Ohh, not compared to you. 
Monica| Well?
Phoebe| They’re not even touching the lasagna!
Monica| Really?!
Phoebe| Oh, they love your casserole.
Monica| Yes!!
Phoebe| It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
Mrs. Geller|  Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.
Monica| And you?
Mrs. Geller| I thought it was… quite tasty.
Monica| So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you…
Mrs. Geller|  A bitch?
Monica| Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.
Mrs. Geller| Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today.
Monica| Wow!
Phoebe| Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica.   She doesn’t know we switched it. 
Mrs. Geller| And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer. 
Monica| That really means a lot. Oh, and Mom, don’t bite your nails.
Chandler|  Hello.
Joey| Hey!
Rachel| Hey!
Ross| Hey!
Monica|  Hello, Chandler. 
Chandler|  I love you. 
Joey| Wh-what’s going on?
Phoebe| Oh. 
Joey| No he doesn’t!
Chandler|  Two hours, that lasted!
Rachel| So did you break up with Joanna?
Chandler| I think so.
Joey| Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
Ross| The volcano?
Joey| Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
Rachel| What?!
Joey| Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
Monica| Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Joey| Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
Monica| Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War? 
All| Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Phoebe| Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
Ross| With such a sad history.
Chandler| Could there be more Kims?
Joanna|  Who’s out there?
Rachel| It’s me! Good morning!
Joanna| Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
Rachel| Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn’t have poppy seed bagels, so I…  Oh my word!
Joanna| I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
Rachel| Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Joanna| You tell your friend Chandler that we’re definately broken up this time.
Rachel| Okay.
