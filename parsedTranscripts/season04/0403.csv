Joey|3| Wait right there
Joey|3| 
Chandler|4| Oh no-no-no, I’m, I’m paddling away
Chandler|4|
Joey|3|  Huh
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Wow
Chandler|4| Really
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| We get all this rusty crap for free
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Uh-huh
Joey|3| This and a bunch of bubble wrap
Joey|3| And, some of it is not even popped
Joey|3| 
Chandler|4| Could we be more white trash
Chandler|4|
Monica|2|  How desperate am I
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Oh
Rachel|1| Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| How come
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Come on, I think this is a good thing
Ross|6| I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do
Ross|6|
Monica|2| You don’t have to stick up for her
Monica|2| She can’t here you
Monica|2|
Rachel|1|  Hey
Rachel|1| Umm, do you guys have any juice
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Just pickle
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Hey uh, Rach, funny story
Chandler|4| I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| My boss, Joanna
Rachel|1| Wow, that must’ve been awkward
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1|  You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4|  No
Chandler|4| No
Chandler|4|
Joanna|0|  Hello, Rachel
Joanna|0| 
Chandler|4| Well, not at first
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| What is she doing here
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| I don’t understand
Rachel|1| Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud
Rachel|1|’
Chandler|4| Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Well, last time I almost got fired
Rachel|1| You must end it, you must end it now
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Oh, come on
Chandler|4| It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me
Chandler|4| I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Chandler
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|  Promise me, you will end it
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Okay, I promise, I’ll end it
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Thank you
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah-eh-eah
Joey|3|  Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant
Joey|3|
Mrs. Geller|0|  How’s the hired help
Mrs. Geller|0|
Monica|2| Doing great, the quiches are coming along
Monica|2|
Mrs. Geller|0| What’s this
Mrs. Geller|0| Blue nail polish
Mrs. Geller|0|
Monica|2| Yeah, I thought it was cute
Monica|2|
Mrs. Geller|0| Ahh, that’s what your Grandmother’s hands looked like when we found her
Mrs. Geller|0|
Monica|2| Let me ask you a question
Monica|2|
Mrs. Geller|0| Hmm
Mrs. Geller|0|
Monica|2| Why did you hire me
Monica|2|
Mrs. Geller|0| Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him
Mrs. Geller|0| Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren’t sleeping with anybody there
Mrs. Geller|0| Though, at least that would be something
Mrs. Geller|0| 
Monica|2|  Oh my God
Monica|2| Did you hear that
Monica|2| She hired me because she thinks I’m good
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Okay, I didn’t hear that
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Oh yeah, she didn’t hire me out of pity, it wasn’t so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I’m good
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Wow
Phoebe|5| And hey, it’s cool if you’re a lesbian
Phoebe|5| 
The Salesman|0|  Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house
The Salesman|0|
Joey|3| Uhhhh
Joey|3| 
The Salesman|0| Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias
The Salesman|0| 
Joey|3| No
Joey|3| No
Joey|3| But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there
Joey|3|
The Salesman|0| Actually, I’m not buying
The Salesman|0| I’m selling
The Salesman|0| Let me ask you one question
The Salesman|0| Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along even though you’re not really sure what they’re talking about
The Salesman|0|
Ross|6| …I’m telling you it’s totally unconstituional
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Oh yeah, I totally agree
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Oh yeah, I totally agree
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Oh yeah, I totally agree
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Oh yeah, I totally agree
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| …I think he deserves a Nobel Prize
Monica|2| 
All|0| Nooo
All|0|
All|0| 
Chandler|4| …it was like the Algonquin kids table
Chandler|4| 
The Salesman|0|  Excuse me, I’m sorry, you haven’t said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested
The Salesman|0|
Joey|3| Yeah-well-yeah
Joey|3| Yeah-oh-yeah
Joey|3| Come on in
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| That’s weird
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| What
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Your nails
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones
Monica|2| I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine now
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2|  Oh my God
Monica|2| Wait a minute, I had them put…  Oh my God
Monica|2| It’s in the quiche
Monica|2| Oh My God
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Okay, don’t panic
Phoebe|5| I’m gonna go to the store, I’m gonna get you another set of nails, no one’s gonna know, and you’re gonna look great
Phoebe|5|  Oh
Phoebe|5| Oh, it’s ‘cause they’re gonna eat—that’s the problem
Phoebe|5|
Mrs. Geller|0|   Honey, don’t bite your nails
Mrs. Geller|0|
Monica|2| Okay ah, please don’t freak out
Monica|2| Umm, but ah, there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to know which one
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| And
Phoebe|5| Whoever finds it wins the prize
Phoebe|5|
Mrs. Geller|0|  I’m not freaking out
Mrs. Geller|0|
Monica|2| Then why are you laughing
Monica|2|
Mrs. Geller|0| It’s nothing, it’s just that now your Father owes me five dollars
Mrs. Geller|0|
Monica|2| What
Monica|2| You bet I’d lose a nail
Monica|2|
Mrs. Geller|0| Oh no, don’t be silly
Mrs. Geller|0| I just bet I’d need these
Mrs. Geller|0| 
Monica|2| Frozen lasagnas
Monica|2|
Mrs. Geller|0| Um-hmm
Mrs. Geller|0|
Monica|2| You bet that I’d screw up
Monica|2|
Monica|2| So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was…
Mrs. Geller|0| No-no-no, that was all true
Mrs. Geller|0| This was just in case you pulled a Monica
Mrs. Geller|0|
Monica|2| You promised Dr
Monica|2| Weinburg, you’d never use that phrase
Monica|2|
Mrs. Geller|0| Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you’ve never been able to laugh at yourself
Mrs. Geller|0|
Monica|2|  That’s right
Monica|2| My Mom doesn’t have any faith in me
Monica|2| Oh, that’s hilarious
Monica|2| Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| I don’t get it
Phoebe|5|
Mrs. Geller|0| No, I have faith…
Monica|2|  No
Monica|2| You have lasagnas
Monica|2| 
Oven|0| Ding
Oven|0|
Phoebe|5| Op, the ruined quiches are ready
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up
Chandler|4|
Joanna|0| No, we are
Joanna|0| I’m sad
Joanna|0|
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4|
Joanna|0|  Yes
Joanna|0|  Uh, can’t you wait until tomorrow
Joanna|0|  All right
Joanna|0|  Unbelievable
Joanna|0|
Joanna|0|
Chandler|4| Thanks
Chandler|4|
Joanna|0| No, no, that was my boss
Joanna|0| I have to go
Joanna|0|
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| 
Joanna|0| What are you doing
Joanna|0|
Chandler|4| I’m getting dressed
Chandler|4|
Joanna|0| Why
Joanna|0|
Chandler|4| When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me
Chandler|4|
Joanna|0| Wait
Joanna|0| I wanna show you something
Joanna|0|
Chandler|4| What is it
Chandler|4|
Joanna|0| Just a little gag gift somebody gave me
Joanna|0|  Put your hands together
Joanna|0|
Chandler|4| Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me
Chandler|4|  Yeah, you are
Chandler|4|  Ooh, saucy
Chandler|4|
Joanna|0|  I’ll be back in ten minutes
Joanna|0| 
Chandler|4| You are, you’re gonna leave me like this
Chandler|4|
Joanna|0| Knowing you’re here, waiting for me I think it’s kinda exciting
Joanna|0|
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| But if you don’t come back soon,  there’s pretty much nothing I can do about it
Chandler|4|
Joanna|0|  Oh
Joanna|0|
Sophie|0| Hi
Sophie|0| I brought you back a macaroon
Sophie|0|
Joanna|0| Oh great
Joanna|0| I’ll keep it in my butt with your nose
Joanna|0| 
Rachel|1| That’s weird, she locked the door
Rachel|1|
Sophie|0| Y’know why
Sophie|0| She’s got the Christmas bonus list in there
Sophie|0| I saw her working on it this morning
Sophie|0|
Rachel|1| Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office
Rachel|1| Do you wanna see the list
Rachel|1|
Sophie|0| Yeah
Sophie|0|
Chandler|4| Hi
Chandler|4|  How are you
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| Hello, Joanna……’s office
Chandler|4|
Joanna|0|  I’m really sorry but I may be a little while longer
Joanna|0|
Chandler|4| How little
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Joanna|0| A couple of hours, I feel awful
Joanna|0|
Chandler|4| Look, this isn’t funny
Chandler|4| You get back here right now
Chandler|4|
Joanna|0| I can’t
Joanna|0|
Joanna|0|
Chandler|4| Why not
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Joanna|0| I’m in my boss’s car
Joanna|0|
Chandler|4| What
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Joanna|0| Uh-oh, tunnel
Joanna|0| 
Rachel|1|   What
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4|  Rachel, could I see you for a moment
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| Okay, here’s the situation
Chandler|4| The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door
Chandler|4| Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me
Chandler|4| And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| You promised you would break up with her
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| I did break up with her
Chandler|4| She just took it really, really well
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| It did enter my mind
Chandler|4| But then something happened that made it, shoot right out
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| No-no-no-no-no-no-no
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| I can’t get myself right out of them
Chandler|4| You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and 
Rachel|1| Oh, Chandler
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| All right, this is it
Rachel|1|  You never see Joanna again
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Never
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| You never come into this office again
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Fine
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| You give me back my Walkman
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| I—never borrowed your Walkman
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Well, then I lost it
Rachel|1| You buy me one
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| You got it
Chandler|4| Here we go
Chandler|4| Come on
Chandler|4| This is great
Chandler|4|  Ahhh
Chandler|4| 
Rachel|1| Does it hurt
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them
Chandler|4|  Hello sweet pants
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Wait a minute
Rachel|1| What are you gonna tell Joanna
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| About what
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| I’ll make something up
Chandler|4| I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were
Rachel|1| 
Chandler|4| Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| Well, this is much better
Chandler|4|

Phoebe|5| So you pulled a Monica
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on
Monica|2|

Phoebe|5| Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| What
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5|" Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, ""Yeah, he pulled a Monica"
Phoebe|5|""" Y'know"
Phoebe|5|" Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, ""Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica"
Phoebe|5|""" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, ""Yeah, that one’s outta here"
Phoebe|5|""" Though some things don’t change"
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2|  All right, I’ll go down there
Monica|2| But, I’m not gonna serve the lasagna

Chandler|4| Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way
Chandler|4| Okay

Rachel|1| Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| How do Monica and Phoebe know
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Oh, I called them
Rachel|1| And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous  or very  stingy
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4|  Go on
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| I can make you a legend
Rachel|1| I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| And Milton Berle has a…
Rachel|1| Ohh, not compared to you
Rachel|1| 
Monica|2| Well
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| They’re not even touching the lasagna
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Really
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Oh, they love your casserole
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Yes
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients
Phoebe|5|
Mrs. Geller|0|  Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish
Mrs. Geller|0|
Monica|2| And you
Monica|2|
Mrs. Geller|0| I thought it was… quite tasty
Mrs. Geller|0|
Monica|2| So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success
Monica|2| Which would make you…
Mrs. Geller|0|  A bitch
Mrs. Geller|0|
Monica|2| Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word
Monica|2|
Mrs. Geller|0| Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today
Mrs. Geller|0|
Monica|2| Wow
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica
Phoebe|5|   She doesn’t know we switched it
Phoebe|5| 
Mrs. Geller|0| And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer
Mrs. Geller|0| 
Monica|2| That really means a lot
Monica|2| Oh, and Mom, don’t bite your nails

Rachel|1| So did you break up with Joanna
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| I think so

Joey|3| Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius
Joey|3|
Ross|6| The volcano
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3| And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden

Joanna|0| Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| Oh, yeah
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1|
