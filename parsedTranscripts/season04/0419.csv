Chandler|4| Screw the Knicks
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Whoa

Chandler|4|
Monica|2| No, we’re not
Monica|2| We’re not leaving

Chandler|4| And I am getting it back right now
Chandler|4| I’m getting back right now
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| All right
Rachel|1| We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Oh no-no-no, no more offers
Chandler|4| You can’t offer anything to us
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Let us keep the apartment and…
