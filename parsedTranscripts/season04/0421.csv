Chandler|4|
Joey|3| I know
Joey|3| Ross is getting married
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Phoebe is, making people
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Everybody’s doing stuff
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| And we just sit here
Chandler|4| I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair
Chandler|4| Look, we have to do something
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| Something huge
Chandler|4|
Joey|3|  We could climb Mt
Joey|3| Everest
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| No-no, not something stupid, something huge
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday
Joey|3| We could totally do that
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Why not
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing
Chandler|4| It’s just, it’s just steep
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| We’re going to Everest
Chandler|4| Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5|  Hey
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| What-what’s up
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| We’re gonna climb Mt
Joey|3| Everest
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yeah baby

Phoebe|5| Really
Phoebe|5|

Phoebe|5| Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y’know you can die
Phoebe|5| And, you would die
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4|  Yeah, well…
Joey|3| We could get that Everest video though
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| And while we’re down at the video store, you know what else we could rent
Joey|3| Die Hard
Joey|3|  Oh, y’know what
Joey|3| I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order
Joey|3|
Chandler|4|  Oh, well…
Phoebe|5| So you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Yeeeeahhhh
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| But I’ll tell you something
Chandler|4| One of these days we’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again

Emily|0|
Ross|6| Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her
Ross|6|
Emily|0| Oh, no-no, y’know I absolutely adore Rachel it’s just that, well it might be a awkward for you
