Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| What
Joey|3| What’s wrong
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| You mean the mom you met in Montauk
Rachel|1| She was a cat
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| No, no-no, she was a human lady
Phoebe|5| This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Are you sure she’s in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma’s glycoma medicine again
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| No Dr
Phoebe|5| Skeptismo
Phoebe|5| I’m sure
Phoebe|5| First of all, okay, there’s the feeling
Phoebe|5|  Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt
Phoebe|5|  My Mother’s favourite fish is Orange Roughy
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|  Cats
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|

Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Hey
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you’re going out with Chip Matthews
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Now
Monica|2| Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Nooo
Rachel|1| It’s not okay
Rachel|1| I can’t believe you would want to after what he did to me
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| What, that little thing at the prom
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Monica
Rachel|1| I couldn’t find him for two hours
Rachel|1| He was having sex with Amy Welch
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Come on, that was back in high school
Monica|2| How could that still bother you
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Look, you and I went to different high schools
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket
Monica|2| I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made
Monica|2|
Rachel|1|  They had to have that specially made
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes
Monica|2|
Rachel|1|  Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out
Monica|2| And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go
Monica|2| I-I owe her this
Monica|2| I never let her eat
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Oh, you go out with him
Rachel|1|  
Monica|2| Oh, really
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1| Just, if it’s possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| I’ll try
Monica|2|
Ross|6| So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don’t think any of them are gonna work out
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process
Chandler|4| Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5|  Stop it
Phoebe|5| Stop it
Phoebe|5| She keeps squirming, trying to get away
Phoebe|5| Just like when she was alive
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Well, I’m not sure
Phoebe|5| I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there’s y'know, a new mom
Phoebe|5| Y'know, I think she’s worried that y'know, she’s gonna, she’s gonna be replaced
Phoebe|5|  Well, that’s not gonna happen is it
Phoebe|5| Noo
Phoebe|5|  Okay, I have to return a call in the other room
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Why can’t you use the phone in here
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Well, I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H
Phoebe|5| I just spelled the wrong word
Phoebe|5| 
Ross|6| So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Ross, don’t start
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Come on, you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-that there’s a woman inside that cat
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| I believe it
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| No you don’t
Ross|6| 
Rachel|1| Yes, I do
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| No you do—y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| I do not always have to be—okay, okay
Ross|6| 
Rachel|1| Jurassic Park could happen
Rachel|1|
Tony|0| Wow
Tony|0| That’s ah, that’s pretty nice

Tony|0| We don’t have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it
Tony|0| We’ve got a canoe
Tony|0|
Chandler|4| Y'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe
Chandler|4|
Tony|0| You gotta take the canoe
Tony|0|
Chandler|4| All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away
Chandler|4|
Peter|0| We’re not throwing it away

Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Yes, we have to tell her
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Oh, but it’s made her so happy
Monica|2|
Ross|6|  Little girl misses her cat
Ross|6|  Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat
Ross|6|  Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her
Ross|6|
All|0|  Yeah
