Rachel|1| It turns out that I’m not free tonight
Rachel|1| So…
Emily|0| Really
Emily|0|
Emily|0| Well, that’s just lovely, isn’t it
Emily|0| I must’ve missed your call, even though I didn’t leave the flat all day
Emily|0| 
Rachel|1| Oh well, no I…
Emily|0| Oh, no-no-no, that’s not rude
Emily|0| It’s perfectly in keeping with a trip that I’ve already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F
Emily|0| Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone who’s got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum
Emily|0|
Monica|2| I-I-I think you look great
Monica|2|
Emily|0| Good night, it was very nice to meet you all
Emily|0|

Phoebe|5| Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3|  Oh my God
Joey|3| I overslept
Joey|3| I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago
Joey|3| I gotta get out of here
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Oh wait, Joey, you can’t go like that
Monica|2| You stink
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don’t have time
Joey|3| They’re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Yeah
Monica|2| Run ten blocks, that’ll help the smell
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Hey—whoa, slow down
Rachel|1|  No, keep moving
Rachel|1|  Wow
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| So
Monica|2| How did it go with Joshua last night
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Well, I didn’t see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| What
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Why
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Ohh
Phoebe|5| So, did you get to meet her
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1|" No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, ""I’m Rachel Greep"
Rachel|1| I’m Rachel Greep
Rachel|1|""" and he let her right in"
Rachel|1| 
Monica|2| So you hit her in the face
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her
Rachel|1| Ohhh
Rachel|1| I can’t believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5|  Aww, Pheebs
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Honey, that’s you’re name
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| That’s short for Phoebe
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| I thought that was just what we called each other
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Hey
Monica|2| You’re wearing pants
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| That’s right
Chandler|4| Where are the guys
Chandler|4| I’m ready to get drunk and see some strippers
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| It’s 9:30 in the morning
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| They got a breakfast buffet
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Hello
Monica|2|  Oh, hey Ross

Rachel|1| How—how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| 
Chandler|4| Maybe, she doesn’t hit him all the time
Chandler|4| 
Ross|6| When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet
Ross|6| Who wouldn’t be miserable
Ross|6| I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person
Ross|6|
Emily|0|  Ross
Emily|0| Come quickly
Emily|0| There’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard
Emily|0|
Ross|6| I’ve gotta go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard
Ross|6| 
Monica|2| He had to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| I don’t get this
Rachel|1| She was horrible
Rachel|1| 
Chandler|4| Okay, I’m going to go stand over there
Chandler|4| 
Monica|2| Why do you care so much anyway
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| I don’t care
Rachel|1| All right, y’know what I’m just upset that I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Oh, y’know, would you just for once, not remember every…little…thing
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| 
Chandler|4| So y’know, uh, when’s he getting back
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| A couple of days
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Y’know, I knew something like this was going to happen
Chandler|4| 
Monica|2| What are you doing
Monica|2|
Monica|2| Chandler
Monica|2| You can’t just go back a phase
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yes you can
Chandler|4| You’re thinking about time, you can’t go back in time

Monica|2| Yeah, come on, we can be guys
Monica|2|
Chandler|4|  No you can’t
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Come on
Phoebe|5| Let us be guys
Phoebe|5| Maybe we want to be guys
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| You don’t want to be guys, you’d be all hairy and wouldn’t live as long
Chandler|4| 
Phoebe|5| Y’know you, you just stop being such a wuss and get those off and you come with us and watch naked girls dance around
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Okay

Joey|3| Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice
Joey|3| 
The A.D|0| There’s no way he smells, he’s the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room
The A.D|0|
Joey|3| Really, a shower huh
Joey|3| And uh, which-which room might that be
Joey|3|
The A.D|0|" The one with ""Heston"" on it"
The A.D|0|

Charlton Heston|0|""" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up"
