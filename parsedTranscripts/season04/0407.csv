Chandler|4|  I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked
Chandler|4| It was like torture
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a big surprise
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| It just keeps getting worse and worse
Chandler|4| Y'know
Chandler|4| I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think she knows
Chandler|4| Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us
Chandler|4| And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too
Chandler|4| And now I have seen her naked
Chandler|4| I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something
Chandler|4| But there are no boles, she’s smooth
Chandler|4| Smooth
Chandler|4| 
Phoebe|5| Wow
Phoebe|5| Could everyone totally see up his robe
Phoebe|5|
All|0| Yeah
All|0| Oh my God
All|0|
Casey|0| Here you go
Casey|0|
Joey|3| Great
Joey|3| All right, so I’ll call you later
Joey|3|
Casey|0| Great
Casey|0| 
Chandler|4|  Hey-Hey-Hey
Chandler|4| Who was that
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| That would be Casey
Joey|3| We’re going out tonight
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Goin’ out, huh
Chandler|4| Wow
Chandler|4| Wow
Chandler|4|  So things didn’t work out with Kathy, huh
Chandler|4| Bummer
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| No, things are fine with Kathy
Joey|3| I’m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey
Joey|3|
Chandler|4|  What
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah-yeah
Joey|3| And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself
Joey|3| 
Chandler|4| Wait
Chandler|4| You’re going out with Kathy
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3| Why are you getting so upset
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Well, I’m upset—for you
Chandler|4| I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3| What is the big deal
Joey|3| It’s not like we’re exclusive
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs
Chandler|4| But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| You got all that from the back of her head
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down
Chandler|4| Y'know
Chandler|4| Make a choice, pick a lane
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Who’s Elaine
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5|"  ""Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair"
Phoebe|5|" Swinging with the greatest of ease…"" Darn it"
Phoebe|5| Now, I don’t know who to get to the next verse
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6|" Oh, you could just go uh, ""greatest of ease…  BAH-bah-bha-bhannn"
Ross|6|""" Then go right into it"
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, ooh, I like that
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5| Wait
Phoebe|5| How do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan
Phoebe|5|’
Ross|6| Well umm, y’know, I used to play
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college
Ross|6| I mean that’s-that’s when I really found my sound
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Oh God
Monica|2| Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it
Monica|2| Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Yeah
Ross|6|
Monica|2| He used to lock himself in the basement for hours
Monica|2|" No one was every allowed to hear, ""The Sound"
Monica|2|""""
Phoebe|5|" I wanna hear ""The Sound"
Phoebe|5|""""
Ross|6| Really
Ross|6| No
Ross|6| I mean, nah, I haven’t played in so long, and-and, well it’s-it’s really personal stuff, y’know
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Come on, play that funky music white boy
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Yeah
Monica|2|
Ross|6| No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in—No, yeah, okay
Ross|6| 
Ross|6| Okay, guys
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| All right
Chandler|4| Bring it on, you…
Ross|6| Here we go
Ross|6|  Y’know, I’ve-I’ve never played my stuff for anyone before, so it’s important that-that you understand it’s about communicating very private emotions
Ross|6|  Y’know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems
Ross|6| That’s what I’m…
Chandler|4|  Oh my God
Chandler|4| Play
Chandler|4|
Monica|2|  Boy, that was-that was, umm… terrific
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Really, bitchin’
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Wow, it was so—wow
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Really
Ross|6|
Ross|6| I mean, really
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Yeah, I mean, you should play in public
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Wow
Ross|6| Thanks, you guys
Ross|6| That’s uh—ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece
Ross|6| Umm

Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6|  This is so nice, I’m—I am so… 
Monica|2| Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Oh, I can’t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| What are you guys talking about, I loved it
Phoebe|5| It was soo moving
Phoebe|5| Oh, plus it’s just, it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| You mean like, music
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| Yeah, I know what you’re thinkin’
Chandler|4| Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy

Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| I uh, don’t really have a preference
Kathy|0| You

Chandler|4|  …of the boat
Chandler|4|   Hello
Chandler|4|
Joey|3|  Hey, it’s me
Joey|3| Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| What happened
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid
Joey|3| And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I’ll be there as soon as I can
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Why can’t you tell her
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| ‘Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to—
Chandler|4| Joey
Chandler|4| Joey
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| I thought your time ran out
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more—
Chandler|4|  Uhh, that was Joey
Chandler|4| He’s running a little late, he says he’s sorry
Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| Oh
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| So I guess it’s just uh, you and me then
Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| Oh, okay
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| Yeah, I think it is
Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| So what did you do today
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut…
Kathy|0|  Oh, it looks great
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| …and then it got canceled
Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| Well, I could cut it
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| Really
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| You do that
Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| Yeah, I do
Kathy|0| Of course, I learned at my aunt’s dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say

Joey|3| I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn’t there
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| What
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah, it must’ve fallen out a few blocks back

Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| Can you really do that
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| I have to; he’s my best friend, and you’re seeing him
Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you…
Chandler|4|  Oh-no-no-no
Chandler|4| Don’t
Chandler|4| Don’t
Chandler|4| See-see, you’re getting me confused, I’m starting to urn
Chandler|4|

Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Phoebe, Ross sucks
Monica|2| 
Rachel|1| Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Oh my God, he’s not even appreciated in his own time
Phoebe|5| I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Okay
Monica|2| Umm, Phoebe, you suck too

Joey|3| What happened here
Joey|3| Did you do all this
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| I sure did
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Why
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Well, I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Well, you’re amazing
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Oh no-no-no
Chandler|4| This is amazing
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3|  A TV as if it appears from nowhere
Joey|3| That’s the dream
Joey|3| Man, how did you afford this stuff
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Well, y’know I’m 29
Chandler|4| I mean who needs a savings account
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Oh, I don’t know
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Oh-no-no-no, you are
Joey|3| You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I’m gonna do that
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| You mean with Casey
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| No-no-no, I think I’m gonna see how things go with Kathy
Joey|3| She’s pretty cool
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Or Casey
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| No-no, Kathy
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Could be Casey
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| No
Joey|3| No, Kathy
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Consider Casey
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Y’know what I think
Joey|3| I think somebody’s got a little crush on Casey
Joey|3| How ‘bout I fix you two up
Joey|3| What do you think
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place
Chandler|4|
Ross|6|  Hey
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Hey
Phoebe|5| You were really great
Phoebe|5| You were really, really great
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Oh, thanks, thanks
Ross|6| So Monica tells me that uh, you don’t want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent
Ross|6| Is that true
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Well, kinda
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Pheebs…
Phoebe|5| Yeah, I-I can’t—I mean y’know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift
Phoebe|5| I…
Ross|6| See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music
Ross|6| Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I… I won’t play anymore
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Oh no
Phoebe|5| No-no-no, don’t do that
Phoebe|5| How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Yeah, okay
Ross|6|
Ross|6| Hey Chandler
Ross|6| Saw the new furniture
Ross|6| Very nice
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Yeah
Monica|2| Joey has the best boyfriend ever
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| I kissed Kathy
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| What
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Are you serious
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Does Joey know
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| No
Chandler|4| Is there anyway, anyway you think he’ll understand this
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| You obviously haven’t screwed over a lot of your friends
Monica|2|  Which we all appreciate
Monica|2|
Ross|6| No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Oh, don’t say that
Chandler|4| Don’t say that
Chandler|4| That’s not true
Chandler|4| Is it
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| I think maybe, yeah
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| He loves you
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Then why didn’t you tell me to do that
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5| No, that’s right
Phoebe|5| And I thought it was a really good idea
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| I know, I remember that
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| I remember you did
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| God
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|  What am I gonna do
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Well, Chandler, you’re gonna have to tell him
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Why
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| Why do I have to tell him
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Because you do
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Yeah, I know
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Hey
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3| Samboucha Margarita
Joey|3| 
Chandler|4| Is that a real thing
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| What’s up
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| It’s-it’s about Kathy
Chandler|4| Umm, uh, I like her
Chandler|4| I like her a lot actually
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| You do
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yeah
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Well, you’re timing couldn’t be better
Joey|3| She’s not my girlfriend anymore
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| What
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah, she broke up with me
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Oh uh, when
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Just now, after acting class
Joey|3| At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that’s why I let people watch
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Oh man, I am so sorry
Chandler|4| Are, are you okay
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Well, I’ve been better
Joey|3| But, I’m all right
Joey|3| So you like her huh
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yes, but I-I uh, don’t have too
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| No-no-no, no it’s uh, it’s okay
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yeah
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3| You know why
Joey|3| ‘Cause you came to me first
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you’re work cut out for you
Joey|3| ‘Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she’s into some other guy
Joey|3| So…
Chandler|4| See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about
Chandler|4| I-I think I know who the other guy is
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Who
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| It’s me
Chandler|4| I’m the other guy
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| What
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…
Joey|3| And what
Joey|3|
Joey|3| Did you sleep with her
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| No
Chandler|4| No
Chandler|4| No
Chandler|4| I just kissed her
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| What
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Joey|3| That’s even worse
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| How is that worse
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| I don’t know
Joey|3| But it’s the same
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Look, I’m sorry
Chandler|4| But there’s nothing I can do, I think I’m in love with her
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Who cares
Joey|3|
Joey|3| You went behind my back
Joey|3| I would never do that to you
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| You’re right, I have no excuses
Chandler|4| I was totally over the line
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Over the line
Joey|3|
Joey|3| You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line
Joey|3| The line is a dot to you
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yes
Chandler|4| Yes
Chandler|4| Right
Chandler|4| And I feel horrible
Chandler|4| You have to believe me
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Is that why you bought all this stuff
Joey|3|
Joey|3|  Well, y’know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I’m not gonna eat
Joey|3| You know why
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Probably because…
Joey|3| Because it’s all tainted with your betrayal
Joey|3| From now on this apartment is empty for me
Joey|3| And I’m not happy about you either
Joey|3|  Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you
Joey|3| 
Phoebe|5| Oh my God, he’s lost it
Phoebe|5| He’s totally lost it
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2|  What
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Phoebe, his music could not get any worse
Rachel|1| There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Thank you, thanks
Ross|6|  Yeah, I lost it
Ross|6| Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| After that
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5| No, I mean if I can help
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Yeah, like I could lose it
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| I played bad on purpose guys
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Yeah—no, just that last song
Ross|6|
