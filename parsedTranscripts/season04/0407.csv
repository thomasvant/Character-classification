Chandler|Chandler|  I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!
Ross|Ross| Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a big surprise.
Chandler|Chandler| It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she’s smooth! Smooth! 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
All|Other| Yeah! Oh my God!
Casey|Other| Here you go.
Joey|Joey| Great! All right, so I’ll call you later.
Casey|Other| Great! 
Chandler|Chandler|  Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Joey|Joey| That would be Casey. We’re going out tonight.
Chandler|Chandler| Goin’ out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didn’t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
Joey|Joey| No, things are fine with Kathy. I’m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
Chandler|Chandler|  What?
Joey|Joey| Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! 
Chandler|Chandler| Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!
Joey|Joey| Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Chandler|Chandler| Well, I’m upset—for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. 
Joey|Joey| What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive.
Chandler|Chandler| Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.
Joey|Joey| You got all that from the back of her head?
Chandler|Chandler| All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Joey|Joey| Who’s Elaine?
Phoebe|Phoebe|"  ""Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease…"" Darn it! Now, I don’t know who to get to the next verse."
Ross|Ross|" Oh, you could just go uh, ""greatest of ease…  BAH-bah-bha-bhannn."" Then go right into it."
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’
Ross|Ross| Well umm, y’know, I used to play.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh?
Ross|Ross| Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that’s-that’s when I really found my sound.
Monica|Monica| Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
Ross|Ross| Yeah.
Monica|Monica|" He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, ""The Sound."""
Phoebe|Phoebe|" I wanna hear ""The Sound."""
Ross|Ross| Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven’t played in so long, and-and, well it’s-it’s really personal stuff, y’know?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Come on, play that funky music white boy.
Monica|Monica| Yeah!
Ross|Ross| No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in—No, yeah, okay. 
Ross|Ross| Okay, guys.
Chandler|Chandler| All right! Bring it on, you…
Ross|Ross| Here we go.  Y’know, I’ve-I’ve never played my stuff for anyone before, so it’s important that-that you understand it’s about communicating very private emotions.  Y’know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That’s what I’m…
Chandler|Chandler|  Oh my God! Play!
Monica|Monica|  Boy, that was-that was, umm… terrific.
Chandler|Chandler| Really, bitchin’!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Wow, it was so—wow!
Ross|Ross| Really?! I mean, really?!!
Rachel|Rachel| Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
Ross|Ross| Wow! Thanks, you guys. That’s uh—ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I’ll be right back! Okay?  This is so nice, I’m—I am so… 
Monica|Monica| Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, I can’t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
Phoebe|Phoebe| What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it’s just, it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear.
Chandler|Chandler| You mean like, music?
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, I know what you’re thinkin’! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
Chandler|Chandler| Come in!
Kathy|Other|  Hey!  Oh God, is that Baywatch?
Chandler|Chandler| Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
Kathy|Other| So is Joey around?
Chandler|Chandler| No-no, he’s not back yet, but he’ll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
Kathy|Other| I uh, don’t really have a preference. You?
Chandler|Chandler| I like it in the stern.  …of the boat.   Hello.
Joey|Joey|  Hey, it’s me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
Chandler|Chandler| What happened?
Joey|Joey| We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I’ll be there as soon as I can.
Chandler|Chandler| Why can’t you tell her?
Joey|Joey| ‘Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to—
Chandler|Chandler| Joey! Joey!!
Joey|Joey| Yeah?
Chandler|Chandler| I thought your time ran out.
Joey|Joey| Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more—
Chandler|Chandler|  Uhh, that was Joey. He’s running a little late, he says he’s sorry.
Kathy|Other| Oh.
Chandler|Chandler| So I guess it’s just uh, you and me then.
Kathy|Other| Oh, okay.
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, I think it is!
Kathy|Other| So what did you do today?
Chandler|Chandler| Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut…
Kathy|Other|  Oh, it looks great!
Chandler|Chandler| …and then it got canceled.
Kathy|Other| Well, I could cut it.
Chandler|Chandler| Really?! You do that?
Kathy|Other| Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt’s dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
Chandler|Chandler| Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don’t make my tail too poofy.
Kathy|Other| You have really great hair.
Chandler|Chandler| Well, thanks. I grow it myself.  Y’know who also has great hair is Joey!
Kathy|Other| Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I’m basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
Chandler|Chandler| What-what ‘cha doin’?
Kathy|Other| Checking to see if it’s even.
Chandler|Chandler| ‘Kay.
Kathy|Other| Looks good.
Chandler|Chandler|  Oh the phone! The phone’s making sounds!  Hello!
Joey|Joey|  Hey dude, it’s me.
Chandler|Chandler| Hey it’s Joey!
Joey|Joey| Listen uh, I’m really sorry, it looks like I’m gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn’t there!
Chandler|Chandler| What?
Joey|Joey| Yeah, it must’ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
Chandler|Chandler| Okay.
Joey|Joey| Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh yeah man.  Joey. 
Kathy|Other|  Hey.  Oh no it’s fine, don’t worry about it.  Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it’s okay.  Yeah! I’ll talk to you tomorrow.   I should uh, probably go.
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah. Yes! Yeah. 
Kathy|Other| I forgot my purse.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh. 
Kathy|Other| No, I really did forget my purse.
Chandler|Chandler| No-no-no-no, this is bad! It’s bad! This is bad!
Kathy|Other| Horrible!
Chandler|Chandler| Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
Kathy|Other| No-no-no, the kiss was good.
Chandler|Chandler| Okay!
Kathy|Other| No, but that’s bad!
Chandler|Chandler| Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here’s what we do, we-we forget it happened.
Kathy|Other| What?!
Chandler|Chandler| Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we’re unhappy forever. Sound good?
Kathy|Other| Can you really do that?
Chandler|Chandler| I have to; he’s my best friend, and you’re seeing him.
Kathy|Other| Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you…
Chandler|Chandler|  Oh-no-no-no! Don’t! Don’t! See-see, you’re getting me confused, I’m starting to urn. 
Kathy|Other| I’m sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
Chandler|Chandler| I-I think we have too.
Kathy|Other| Okay. Bye.
Chandler|Chandler| Bye.  Are you still out there?
Kathy|Other|  No. 
Ross|Ross|  Electrifying.  Emphatic time-time-time…
Monica|Monica|  Y'know, there’s a Starbucks about three blocks down.
Phoebe|Phoebe|  It’s so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
Ross|Ross|  Thank you guys-guys-guys…
Monica|Monica|  Hey, aren’t you up next?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh no, I’m not playing tonight.
Rachel|Rachel| Why not?
Phoebe|Phoebe| I can’t follow Ross! It’d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
Monica|Monica| Phoebe, Ross sucks! 
Rachel|Rachel| Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh my God, he’s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Monica|Monica| Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Rachel|Rachel| Yeah, Phoebe you’re… awful!
Phoebe|Phoebe| You guys. You suck too. 
Joey|Joey| Aww man! I can’t believe I locked myself out again! 
Chandler|Chandler| Hang on buddy! 
Joey|Joey|  Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?
Chandler|Chandler| I sure did.
Joey|Joey| Why?
Chandler|Chandler| Well, I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Joey|Joey| Well, you’re amazing.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. 
Joey|Joey|  A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That’s the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?
Chandler|Chandler| Well, y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Joey|Joey| Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh, I don’t know.
Joey|Joey| Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I’m gonna do that.
Chandler|Chandler| You mean with Casey.
Joey|Joey| No-no-no, I think I’m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She’s pretty cool.
Chandler|Chandler| Or Casey.
Joey|Joey| No-no, Kathy.
Chandler|Chandler| Could be Casey.
Joey|Joey| No. No, Kathy.
Chandler|Chandler| Consider Casey.
Joey|Joey| Y’know what I think? I think somebody’s got a little crush on Casey. How ‘bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
Chandler|Chandler| That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Ross|Ross|  Hey!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
Ross|Ross| Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don’t want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
Ross|Ross| Pheebs…
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah, I-I can’t—I mean y’know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I…
Ross|Ross| See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I… I won’t play anymore.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh no. No-no-no, don’t do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
Ross|Ross| Yeah, okay.
Ross|Ross| Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Monica|Monica| Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Chandler|Chandler| I kissed Kathy.
Ross|Ross| What?
Monica|Monica| Are you serious?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Does Joey know?
Chandler|Chandler| No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he’ll understand this?
Monica|Monica| You obviously haven’t screwed over a lot of your friends.  Which we all appreciate.
Ross|Ross| No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh, don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Is it?
Phoebe|Phoebe| I think maybe, yeah.
Monica|Monica| He loves you.
Chandler|Chandler| Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!
Ross|Ross| Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah! No, that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
Rachel|Rachel| I know, I remember that!
Monica|Monica| I remember you did.
Chandler|Chandler| God!!  What am I gonna do?!
Rachel|Rachel| Well, Chandler, you’re gonna have to tell him.
Chandler|Chandler| Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Rachel|Rachel| Because you do.
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, I know.
Ross|Ross| Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
Chandler|Chandler| Hey!
Joey|Joey| Hey! Samboucha Margarita? 
Chandler|Chandler| Is that a real thing?
Joey|Joey| Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
Chandler|Chandler| Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
Joey|Joey| What’s up?
Chandler|Chandler| It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.
Joey|Joey| You do?
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah.
Joey|Joey| Well, you’re timing couldn’t be better. She’s not my girlfriend anymore.
Chandler|Chandler| What?
Joey|Joey| Yeah, she broke up with me.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh uh, when?
Joey|Joey| Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that’s why I let people watch.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Joey|Joey| Well, I’ve been better. But, I’m all right. So you like her huh?
Chandler|Chandler| Yes, but I-I uh, don’t have too.
Joey|Joey| No-no-no, no it’s uh, it’s okay.
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah?
Joey|Joey| Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you came to me first.
Chandler|Chandler| Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
Joey|Joey| But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you’re work cut out for you. ‘Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she’s into some other guy. So…
Chandler|Chandler| See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Joey|Joey| Who?
Chandler|Chandler| It’s me. I’m the other guy.
Joey|Joey| What?
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…
Joey|Joey| And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
Chandler|Chandler| No! No! No! I just kissed her.
Joey|Joey| What?!! That’s even worse!!
Chandler|Chandler| How is that worse?!
Joey|Joey| I don’t know! But it’s the same!
Chandler|Chandler| Look, I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do, I think I’m in love with her!
Joey|Joey| Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
Chandler|Chandler| You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Joey|Joey| Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Chandler|Chandler| Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Joey|Joey| Is that why you bought all this stuff?!  Well, y’know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I’m not gonna eat! You know why?!
Chandler|Chandler| Probably because…
Joey|Joey| Because it’s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I’m not happy about you either.  Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.
Monica|Monica|  What?
Rachel|Rachel| Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
Ross|Ross| Thank you, thanks.  Yeah, I lost it. Y’know, I’m not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?
Phoebe|Phoebe| After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.
Ross|Ross| Yeah, like I could lose it.
Rachel|Rachel| What?
Ross|Ross| I played bad on purpose guys.
Monica|Monica| Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
Ross|Ross| Yeah—no, just that last song.
