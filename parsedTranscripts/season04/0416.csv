Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Yes
Phoebe|5| Yes
Phoebe|5| Yes
Phoebe|5| I can’t believe it
Phoebe|5| The baby wants bologna
Phoebe|5| Maybe he wants me to eat meat
Phoebe|5| I can’t eat meat
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Oh, wait-wait
Joey|3|  Maybe it’s a pickle
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| What are you writing

Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Oh yeah
Chandler|4|  Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you  never go out of style—what did you throw away

Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Without me
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Emily|0| My uncle dragged us there
Emily|0| But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Yeah
Ross|6|
Emily|0| They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that
Emily|0| 
Monica|2| I don’t know how museums work in England but, here, you’re not supposed to take stuff
Monica|2|
Emily|0| I uh, I got it from the gift shop
Emily|0| They have really lax security there
Emily|0|  It’s a joke
Emily|0| 
Ross|6| Bye
Ross|6| 
Emily|0| Right, I’ve got to be off, I’ll see ya
Emily|0| Buh-bye then
Emily|0| 
Joey|3| Wow
Joey|3| You guys seem to be having a good time
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Oh yeah, she’s-she’s amazing
Ross|6| And-and she’s so much fun
Ross|6| And
Ross|6| Y’know what
Ross|6| When I’m with her, I’m fun
Ross|6| I even signed up for helicopter classes
Ross|6|  She’s leaving in two days, I don’t have to do it
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Oh no, two days, you must be bummed
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Yeah, she’s got to go back to London
Ross|6| But you know what
Ross|6| I’ve been prepared for this from the start
Ross|6| We both knew we had two weeks together, and that’s it
Ross|6| Y’know
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Hey that’s what all my relationships are like
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Pheebs
Ross|6|
All|0| Hey
All|0|
Ross|6|  Hello
Ross|6| Hello
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5|  Yes
Phoebe|5| I know
Phoebe|5| I know
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5| So the baby is totally craving meat
Phoebe|5| This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y’know
Phoebe|5| And I got nauseous
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Being pregnant is tough on your tummy
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| That’s sweat
Phoebe|5| You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glow too
Phoebe|5|
Joshua|0|  Okay
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Oh, here’s that trench-coat that you wanted
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Oh great
Joshua|0|  Wow
Joshua|0| Yeah, it’s comfortable
Joshua|0| 
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing
Joshua|0| 
Rachel|1|  Oh no-no, no-no, they don’t want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Why not
Joshua|0|
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Well, that’s because of a lot of…
Joshua|0| Y’know, they ruin it for everybody
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| I know
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Y’know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Oh
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Well, congratulations, so do you love her
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| No, no, no, she’s nice but, y’know, it just it made me realize that I’m just not, I’m just not ready to be dating, y’know
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Huh
Rachel|1| Well, uh, that’s uh, that’s interesting
Rachel|1| 
Joshua|0|  Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Oh, it’s just an anti-theft device
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Then uh, what’s-what’s this
Joshua|0| 
Rachel|1| You need that, you need that too ‘cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up
Rachel|1| 
Rachel|1| Oops, sorry
Rachel|1| Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight
Rachel|1| Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| What are you talking about
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah, what’ going on
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily
Rachel|1| But it’s actually for Joshua
Rachel|1|  Look, he said he’s not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him
Rachel|1| 
Ross|6| Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here
Ross|6| All right
Ross|6| I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned
Ross|6| So I’m sorry, no party
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Awwww
Joey|3|
Emily|0|  Hello
Emily|0|
Rachel|1| Surprise
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Emily|0| No one’s ever thrown me a surprise party before
Emily|0|
Rachel|1| Well, it was all Ross’s idea
Rachel|1|
Emily|0| You’re so sweet
Emily|0| And I’m so surprised
Emily|0|
Ross|6| You really didn’t know
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there
Chandler|4| 
Rachel|1| Uhh, because I’m trying to play hard to get

Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Like what
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| What-what-what is so funny
Joey|3|
Chandler|4|" I said, ""Like what"
Chandler|4|""""
Joey|3| Now that’s a thinker
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Okay, y’know what, y’know what
Rachel|1| This playing hard to get thing is not working

Rachel|1| Y’know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue
Rachel|1| 
Joshua|0| You okay
Joshua|0|  You all right
Joshua|0| 
Ross|6|  So we should probably get going soon
Ross|6|
Emily|0| Oh, but the party’s only just getting started
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner
Ross|6|
Emily|0| So why did you plan a party at the same time
Emily|0|
Ross|6| No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short
Ross|6|" It’s usually, ""Surprise"
Ross|6|""" And then, ""Oh my God, I’m so surprised—good-bye"
Ross|6|""""
Emily|0| But Ross, I’m such having a great time
Emily|0| Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Monica said that did she
Ross|6| 
Phoebe|5| Ooh, yeah
Phoebe|5| Then what are you going to put on top of that
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| A little salami
Joey|3| 
Phoebe|5| Ooh yeah
Phoebe|5| Then umm, what goes on top of the salami
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Pastrami
Joey|3| 
Phoebe|5| Oooh, yeah

Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Yeah

Rachel|1|
Monica|2| You changed
Monica|2|

Joey|3| What
Joey|3| Were you like in the movie, or… Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve
Joey|3| Very sexy, and classy
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| It’s not Christmas
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Or Spin the Bottle
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| He’s not 11
Rachel|1|
Emily|0|  Thank you so much for this

Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| No
Rachel|1| You guys can’t leave yet
Rachel|1| You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| What big thing
Ross|6|
Rachel|1|  So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther
Rachel|1|  All right
Rachel|1| Who wants to go first
Rachel|1|
Emily|0| I’ll go
Emily|0|
All|0| Yay
All|0|
Joey|3| Welcome to America

Rachel|1| Emily
Rachel|1| 
Chandler|4| What are the odds
Chandler|4| What are the odds
Chandler|4|
Ross|6|  Okay, that-that’s enough
Ross|6| Y’know, let’s, let’s let someone else play
Ross|6|
Joey|3| If you didn’t want to play, why did you come to the party
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Okay, my turn
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Oh my God
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| The baby just kicked
Phoebe|5|
All|0| Ohh

Rachel|1| It kicked once, it’ll kick again
Rachel|1|
All|0| Oh my God
All|0|
Rachel|1| All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting
Rachel|1| 
Rachel|1| Just a bug
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it
Phoebe|5| Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat
Phoebe|5| Because it’s murder, cold blooded murder
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| 
Chandler|4| There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3| Phoebe, what-what are you doing
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| I can’t help it
Phoebe|5| I need the meat
Phoebe|5| The baby needs the meat
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| All right look, y’know how-y’know how when you’re dating someone and you don’t want to cheat on them, unless it’s with someone really hot
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, totally
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| All right
Joey|3| Okay
Joey|3| Well this is the same kind of deal
Joey|3| If you’re going to do something wrong,  do it right
Joey|3|
Joey|3| Feel better now
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, but at what cost
Phoebe|5| Six more months, three meals a day, I’m gonna eat like, y’know millions of cows
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| What
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Well, I eat a lot of meat right
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Well, suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it
Joey|3| No extra animals would die, you-you’d just be eating my animals
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Absolutely
Joey|3| I could be a vegetarian
Joey|3| There’s no meat in beer, right
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away
Ross|6|
Emily|0| But, we can’t go now
Emily|0| It looks like Rachel’s gonna put on a skit
Emily|0|
Monica|2| Oh my God
Monica|2| Have you lost your mind
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| No-n-n-n-no
Rachel|1| I am finally thinking clearly
Rachel|1| My lucky dress wasn’t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can’t let—, actually I kinda want to see what happens
Monica|2|

Rachel|1| If these walls could talk, y’know what they’d say
Rachel|1| Wanna hear some memories
Rachel|1| 
Joshua|0| Need uh, need a little hand there
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Oh no-no-no
Rachel|1| No, I got this all under control

Joshua|0| That’s…
Rachel|1| Ughhhh
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| Forget it
Rachel|1|  This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Well, what was supposed to happen
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Can you not look at me when I say this
Rachel|1|  I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Huh
Joshua|0| Oh, boy
Joshua|0|  Uhh, I-I don’t wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Well, I’m sorry, I thought you needed them
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Why

Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Because I-I like you
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| You like me
Rachel|1|

Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Yeah but-but-but you liked me
Rachel|1| Oh my God, I can’t believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| But…
Rachel|1| Oh no-no-no don’t say but
Rachel|1| No-no, but’s never good
Rachel|1| Let’s just leave it at, you like me and I like you
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Okay uh, however…
Rachel|1| Oh, now see that’s a fancy but
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| My marriage like just ended, and I’m really not ready to get into anything yet
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| But…
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| I’m sorry, I, I just need a little time
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Okay

Rachel|1|
Ross|6| That’s okay
Ross|6| She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so…
Rachel|1| Oh, Ross, I’m sorry

Rachel|1|
Ross|6| What do you mean
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| You seem to really like her
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Yeah, I really do
Ross|6| Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| You think
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Hey, you’re right
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Thanks
Ross|6|  What photo album was it
Ross|6|
