Chandler|4| Okay, she is the star of the play
Chandler|4| And she is my girlfriend
Chandler|4| I get to have sex with the star of the play
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| People can hear you
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| I know
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| Wow
Chandler|4| She looks great
Chandler|4| Doesn’t she
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Yeah
Ross|6|
Kathy's Co-Star|0| Hi
Kathy's Co-Star|0|
Kathy|0| Hi
Kathy|0|
Ross|6| That is one good looking man
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Kathy's Co-Star|0| Sooo, you’ve been doing this long
Kathy's Co-Star|0|
Kathy|0| No, you’re my first
Kathy|0| Put the money on the table
Kathy|0|
Kathy's Co-Star|0| Oh, yeah
Kathy's Co-Star|0| Ooh, that’s nice
Kathy's Co-Star|0| 
Ross|6| Dude
Ross|6|
Kathy's Co-Star|0| Is that an expensive blouse
Kathy's Co-Star|0|
Kathy|0| If you want it to be
Kathy|0| 
Ross|6| Here’s your girlfriend’s button
Ross|6| 
Phoebe|5| Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere
Monica|2| Why
Monica|2| 
Phoebe|5| Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Hey, Rach
Monica|2| I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room
Monica|2| If you could just……throw your purses at it
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Bloomingdale’s eliminated my department
Rachel|1| 
Monica|2| Oh my God, are you out of a job
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| No, but they stuck me in personal shopping
Rachel|1| Which is just a huge step down
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Personal shopping
Phoebe|5| What is that
Phoebe|5| Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Uh-huh
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| That sounds great
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3|  Hey
Joey|3| 
Monica|2| Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments
Monica|2| You can’t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended
Monica|2|
Joey|3|  There’s gravy
Joey|3|
Monica|2| If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time
Monica|2| That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that’s your department now
Monica|2| 
Monica|2| What are you doing
Monica|2|
Joey|3| I think I left a donut up here
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Hey
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Hey
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Ooh
Phoebe|5| How was Kathy’s play
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| That’s a good idea for a business
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| I’m totally screwed
Chandler|4| Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me
Chandler|4|" Y'know it’ll be like, ""So where’s your boyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester"
Chandler|4|""" And she’ll go, ""No-no-no, it’s Chandler"
Chandler|4|""" And he’ll go, ""Whatever"
Chandler|4| Ha-ha-ha-ha
Chandler|4|""""
Joey|3|  That-that is a good trick
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| All right, look, look, what am I gonna do
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Chandler, look they’re actors
Joey|3| They’re there to do a job, just ‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together
Joey|3| I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman
Joey|3| 
Ross|6| Yeah
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| They’re not a couple
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Oh-okay, I get the game now
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Oh yeah
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Well okay, so then you’re fine
Joey|3| The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone
Joey|3| Okay
Joey|3| So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about
Joey|3| It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Really
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage
Joey|3|
Ross|6| No
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Noooo
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Y’know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Yeah, I know but…
Ross|6| Oh no-no-no, I’m there
Ross|6|
Monica|2|  Hey
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Hey Mon
Joey|3| Want some pancakes
Joey|3|
Monica|2| You made pancakes
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Yep
Joey|3| Grab a plate
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Okay
Monica|2| 
Joey|3| No-no, stay right there
Joey|3|  Gettin’ closer
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades
Chandler|4| Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Oh yeah
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Oh yeah, who’s playing
Joey|3|
Monica|2| The players
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess
Ross|6|
Monica|2|  Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is
Monica|2|
Joey|3| All right Pheebs, stick out your plate
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5| 
Rachel|1|  Monica, I’m quitting
Rachel|1| I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn’t even buy it
Rachel|1|  I’m telling you I’m quitting
Rachel|1| That’s it
Rachel|1| I’m talking to my boss right now
Rachel|1|  Yes I am
Rachel|1|  Yes I am
Rachel|1| Yes I am
Rachel|1| Yes I am
Rachel|1| Yes I am
Rachel|1| Yes I am
Rachel|1| Okay bye, call me when you get this message

Mr. Waltham|0| And you have a customer
Mr. Waltham|0| 
Rachel|1| Hi
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Hi, I’m Joshua
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Hi, I’m Rachel Green
Rachel|1| What can I do for you Joshua
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Well, I need a whole new wardrobe
Joshua|0| My wife, well my ex-wife…
Rachel|1| Oh, I’m so sorry
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Anyway, she burned all of my clothes
Joshua|0| I got away with two things
Joshua|0| This suit and what turned out to be a skirt
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Well, at least that’s a great suit
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Yeah, but it wasn’t much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt
Joshua|0|  So I need everything down to underwear, so if you’re willing, I’m all yours
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1|
Mr. Waltham|0| Rachel, you needed to speak to me
Mr. Waltham|0|
Rachel|1| No-no, that wasn’t me
Rachel|1|  Well, we should get started
Rachel|1| Let me show you my underwear
Rachel|1|  The selection of underwear we carry
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| Oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way
Rachel|1| 
Joshua|0| It’s this way
Joshua|0| Sorry
Joshua|0| 
Chandler|4| I’m right
Chandler|4| Right
Chandler|4| There was like no chemistry between them
Chandler|4| Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat
Chandler|4| Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions
Ross|6| All right
Ross|6| There was some sexual chemistry between them
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Here she comes
Ross|6| Don’t say a word, okay
Ross|6| Just be cool, don’t be…y'know you
Ross|6|
Kathy|0| Hey you guys
Kathy|0|
Ross|6| Hey
Ross|6|
Kathy|0| Hi
Kathy|0|  Thank you so much for coming again
Kathy|0| Did you like it tonight
Kathy|0|
Ross|6| Oh, absolutely
Ross|6| 
Kathy|0| Wasn’t Nick funny when he couldn’t get his match lit
Kathy|0|
Kathy|0| It’s a good play, isn’t it
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| Oh, I loved the play
Chandler|4| You were great, and Nick ditto
Chandler|4| Clearly you’re having sex with him
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Okay, I… 
Kathy|0| Clearly, I’m having sex with him
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| Oh come on, it was so obvious
Chandler|4| There was no chemistry between you two
Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| Okay, so let me just get this straight
Kathy|0| You’re accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing
Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| Acting
Kathy|0| Chandler, this is my job
Kathy|0| I’m-I’m playing a part in a play
Kathy|0| How can you not trust me
Kathy|0|
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| Well, you can understand, given how we started
Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| Oh, wow
Kathy|0| I can’t believe you’re throwing that in my face
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying this
Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| I’ll tell you what, Chandler, why don’t you call me when you grow up
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| Yeah, well, don’t expect that to happen anytime soon
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| I have the best job in the entire world
Rachel|1| The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Rachel has a new doll
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises
Rachel|1| Oh
Rachel|1| And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua
Rachel|1| Josh-u-a
Rachel|1| Joshua
Rachel|1| Josh
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Uh, hello
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Hi-e

Ross|6| Cookies and porn, you’re the best mom ever
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| What
Phoebe|5| What
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| It’s Joshua
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Oh, whatever
Ross|6| 
Monica|2| Wait
Monica|2| Wait
Monica|2| This isn’t take-out
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5|  Well, I hate to eat and run, but…
Monica|2| No, wait, please don’t go
Monica|2| I’ve got porn for you too
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, I don’t need it
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| People are supposed to wanna hang out here
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Why
Rachel|1| Honey, what is the big deal
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| I’m the hostess
Monica|2| Not those guys
Monica|2| I’m always the hostess
Monica|2| I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| ‘Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them
Monica|2| But I’m-I’m done now
Monica|2| They’ve suffered enough
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out here
Phoebe|5| 
Rachel|1| Yeah, that’s true
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| All right then, when I’m done with this place, it’s gonna be ten times better than that place
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Oh, are we gonna trash that place
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Steps
Chandler|4|  Slut
Chandler|4|  You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy
Chandler|4|
All|0| What
All|0|
All|0|
Ross|6| So you were right
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| I confronted her, and she didn’t deny it
Chandler|4|  I don’t live here
Chandler|4| 
Ross|6| Chandler
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Chandler, what did she say
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Wait a minute
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Come here
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Are you sure
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said
Chandler|4| Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie’s…
Rachel|1| Beefsteak Charlie’s
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Yes
Chandler|4| See you and I have always been like—
Rachel|1| Whoops
Rachel|1|  Oh, hey, do you need help with that
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Nah, I got it
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum
Rachel|1| 
Rachel|1| Hi
Rachel|1|
All|0| Hey
All|0|
Rachel|1| So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out
Rachel|1| It’s just so frustrating
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Why don’t you ask him out
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Oh, yeah, totally
Joey|3| That’s such a turn-on
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Really
Rachel|1| It doesn’t seem desperate
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| He just got a divorce right
Phoebe|5| 
Rachel|1| Hmm-mmm
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| So he’s probably really nervous around women, y'know
Phoebe|5| Maybe, you just have to make the first move
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5|  You’ve never asked a guy out
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| No
Rachel|1| Have you
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Thousands of times
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| That doesn’t make me sound too good does it
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| I don’t even know how I would go about it
Rachel|1|
Joey|3|" Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, ""Hey, how you doin’"
Joey|3|""""
Phoebe|5| Oh, please
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3|  Hey, how you doin’
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| You know what, I’m gonna do that, I’m gonna call him up, and I’m gonna ask him out
Rachel|1| I can do that
Rachel|1| Ask him out
Rachel|1|  How you doin’
Rachel|1|  Hi
Rachel|1| Joshua
Rachel|1| It’s Rachel Green from Bloomingdale’s
Rachel|1|  Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today
Rachel|1| Well, we found a wallet, and we— the license
Rachel|1| Well, that is a good idea
Rachel|1| Uh, well, let’s see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home
Rachel|1| I’ll see you tomorrow
Rachel|1| Bye
Rachel|1|   You’ve done that a thousand times
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| I’ve never done that
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too
Joey|3| Like uh, Knicks tickets
Joey|3| Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Really
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| You think that will work
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Absolutely
Joey|3| And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket
Joey|3|
Joey|3| What the heck is that
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Did she call
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| No, sorry
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| All right, maybe I should call her
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| No
Joey|3| Forget her, man
Joey|3| You don’t need her, you don’t need that
Joey|3|
Ross|6| He’s right, what she did was unforgivable
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| How might you be wrong
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Dude, tell me she actually told you this
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat
Chandler|4| Back me up here, Ross
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| That’s all you’re basing this on
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| That’s not backing me up
Chandler|4| Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory
Joey|3| There’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out
Joey|3| The lone gunman
Joey|3| Communism
Joey|3| Geometry
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Oh my God
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Would you like to go to a basketball game with me
Rachel|1|  You know, its funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets too…  Umm, who likes the Knicks—
Joshua|0| What do you think
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Oh

Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Yeah-eah-ha
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Thanks
Joshua|0|  Maybe I’ll see in the spring, with the uh, y’know, for the uh, bathing suits
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Oh well, you don’t want to do that now
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Ah, that’s okay, thanks
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Anyway, hopefully, I’ll see you around sometime
Joshua|0| 
Rachel|1| Basketball
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0|  I’m sorry
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re interested, just as a thank you for this week
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Wow
Joshua|0| That would be great
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Really
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Yeah, that would be fantastic
Joshua|0| My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks
Joshua|0| This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel
Joshua|0| 
Mr. Waltham|0| Good morning
Mr. Waltham|0|
Joshua|0| Hi
Joshua|0|
Kathy|0|  Hey
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| Hey
Chandler|4| I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry
Chandler|4| Y’know
Chandler|4| I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset
Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| Oh wow
Kathy|0| I really wish you’d call me
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y’know I-I think this is a good thing
Chandler|4| Y'know
Chandler|4| ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on
Chandler|4| Y’know, I know for me— Nick’s pants
Chandler|4|
Kathy|0| Yeah
Kathy|0|
Chandler|4| Yeah
Chandler|4| Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Okay, for next time, what do you say
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| I have an extra ticket
Rachel|1| An extra ticket
Rachel|1| Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| He didn’t turn me down
Rachel|1| He’s at the game isn’t he
Rachel|1| I got the date, I’m just not on it
Rachel|1|
Monica|2|  Okay, it’s ready
Monica|2| Come on
Monica|2|
Joey|3| What’s ready
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Just come
Monica|2| 
Ross|6| Oh my God
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Wow
Rachel|1| Monica
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Great
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| This is beautiful
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Oh did you—what did you—did you work for two days straight
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Pretty much
Monica|2|  So, what do you, what do you think of the floor
Monica|2|
Joey|3| I don’t know, it looks the same
Joey|3|
Monica|2| You used to have carpet
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Oh yeah
Joey|3|
Monica|2| So I made snacks
Monica|2| Please, just hang out okay
Monica|2| I’m just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking
Monica|2| I’m always the hostess
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Hey
Ross|6|
Joey|3| How’d it go
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Oh good
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| She is now
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| What are you saying
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| I’m saying that she… is a devil woman
Chandler|4| Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick
Chandler|4| Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples
Chandler|4| I hate him, I hate her
Chandler|4| Well, I don’t hate her, I love her
Chandler|4| This is all my fault really
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| How
Phoebe|5| How is your fault
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Because, I-I should’ve called
Chandler|4| Y’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together
Chandler|4| I threw her at his man nipples
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Well, if-if she thought they were on a break…
Mr. Waltham|0| Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold
Mr. Waltham|0| A Joshua Bergen
Mr. Waltham|0| 
Rachel|1| Really
Rachel|1|
Mr. Waltham|0| Will you call him
Mr. Waltham|0|
Rachel|1| Yes
Rachel|1| I will
Rachel|1| Absolutely
Rachel|1|  Hello, Rachel
Rachel|1| Hi, Joshua
Rachel|1| I left my wallet here on purpose
Rachel|1| Really
Rachel|1| Yes, I just wanted to see you again
Rachel|1| Oh, I’m glad
Rachel|1| Rachel, I’d like to say something to you
Rachel|1| Yes
Rachel|1| How you doin’
Rachel|1|
