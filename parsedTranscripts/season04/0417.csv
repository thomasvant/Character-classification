Mr. Treeger|0| Ohhh, man
Mr. Treeger|0|
Mr. Treeger|0|
Joey|3|  What is that
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Treeger’s snaking the shower drain
Chandler|4|
Mr. Treeger|0| What in the name of hell
Mr. Treeger|0|
Joey|3| Maybe he found you flip-flop
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Hey
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Whoa
Joey|3| Is this porn
Joey|3| What did I do
Joey|3| I must’ve hit something on the remote
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Do we pay for this
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| No, we didn’t even pay our cable bill—maybe this is how they punish us
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill—free phone sex
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Maybe we shouldn’t pay our gas bill
Joey|3| 
Mr. Treeger|0|  Whoa, hey, that lady’s all kinds of naked
Mr. Treeger|0|
Chandler|4| Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on
Chandler|4|
Mr. Treeger|0| Yeah, it happened to me once
Mr. Treeger|0| I was just flipping through the channels and bam
Mr. Treeger|0| It was like finding money
Mr. Treeger|0|
Chandler|4| Like finding money with naked people on it
Chandler|4|
Mr. Treeger|0| Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again
Mr. Treeger|0| And I’m sad
Mr. Treeger|0| 
Joey|3|  Why would he turn off the TV
Joey|3| 
Rachel|1| All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat
Rachel|1| 
Chandler|4| We don’t know what could make this go away
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah, so no one touches the remote
Joey|3| And no one touches the TV
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| And no one touches the air around the TV
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Well at least, I’m going to mute it
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| We still have porn
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5|  Hi
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Hi
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Honey, what are you doing
Rachel|1| That’s too heavy
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Give it here
Rachel|1|  Oh, God
Rachel|1| 
Monica|2| Okay
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Ohh, I’m getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table
Phoebe|5| Y’know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table
Phoebe|5| 
Chandler|4| Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| You mean like a doctor
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Pheebs
Joey|3| You’re blocking the porn
Joey|3| Look out
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Ohh
Phoebe|5|  Oh my

Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Hi
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Hi
Monica|2|
Ross|6| So uh, Emily just went to the airport
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Oh
Monica|2| Why didn’t you take her
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it
Ross|6| And y’know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so…
Monica|2| You must feel horrible
Monica|2| Hey
Monica|2| The guys have free porn
Monica|2|
Ross|6|  Nah
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Hey, cheer up
Monica|2| You’re gonna see her again, right
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Well I, that’s the thing, I don’t know
Ross|6|" I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said,  ""This is so fantastic"
Ross|6| Why do we have to talk about the future
Ross|6|" Let’s just enjoy…"""
Monica|2|  No-no-no, don’t-don’t do the accent
Monica|2| You’ve got to see her again
Monica|2|
Ross|6| And why do you care so much
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Because
Monica|2| You could get to live out my fantasy
Monica|2|
Ross|6| You had fantasies about Emily
Ross|6|
Monica|2| No
Monica|2| Y’know, the fantasy
Monica|2| Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Ahh
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Do you love her
Monica|2|
Ross|6| We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know
Ross|6|
Monica|2| You love her
Monica|2|
Ross|6| What-what is love really
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Ohhh, I knew you loved her
Monica|2| Then you need to go to the airport and tell her
Monica|2| You’re probably just gonna catch her just as she’s about to go to the gate
Monica|2|" You’re gonna call out her name and say, ""I love you"
Monica|2|""" And she’s gonna say, ""I love you, too"
Monica|2|""" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud"
Monica|2|
Ross|6| I am a good kisser
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in…  I’ve been watching too much porn
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Is that the heartbeat
Rachel|1|
The Doctor|0| That’s it
The Doctor|0|
Phoebe|5| Oh my God
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Oh wow
Rachel|1| This is so cool
Rachel|1|
The Doctor|0| Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births
The Doctor|0|
Phoebe|5| Why don’t take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I’ll hold onto your card, okay
Phoebe|5|
The Doctor|0| No, I’m getting three separate heartbeats
The Doctor|0|
Phoebe|5| Three
Phoebe|5| You guys were worried I wouldn’t even have one
Phoebe|5|
The Doctor|0| Doctors are wrong all the time
The Doctor|0|
Phoebe|5| Well, yeah
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
The Doctor|0| Definitely
The Doctor|0| 
Phoebe|5| Oh my God
Phoebe|5| Oh my God
Phoebe|5| Oh my God
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| So I-I mean so in a few months I’m going to have three full grown babies just walkin’ around inside me
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5| And it’s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out
Phoebe|5|
The Doctor|0| Actually, giving birth to three babies isn’t that different from giving birth to one
The Doctor|0|
Phoebe|5| What do you know
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Alice|0|  Oh-oh, Phoebe
Alice|0|
Phoebe|5| Ooh
Phoebe|5| Hi
Phoebe|5|
Alice|0| Hi
Alice|0|  So, how did it go at the doctors
Alice|0|
Phoebe|5|" Oh well, okay, hey, y’know how when you’re umm, you’re walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, ""Oh, that’s nice"
Phoebe|5|""""
Frank|0| Yes
Frank|0|
Phoebe|5| Okay, yeah well, good news, you’re going to have three babies
Phoebe|5|
Alice|0| Three babies
Alice|0|
Frank|0| I finally got my band
Frank|0|
Alice|0| We’re gonna have a big family, I’ve always wanted a big family
Alice|0|
Phoebe|5| Oh God, I’m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0| Why would we be freaked
Frank|0|
Phoebe|5| No, no maybe ‘cause it’s harder to raise them, and the added expense, and…
Frank|0|  Oh
Frank|0|
Alice|0| Right
Alice|0|
Phoebe|5| No, back to happy
Phoebe|5| Back to happy
Phoebe|5|
Alice|0| No-no-no, no, it’s going to be fine
Alice|0| Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long
Alice|0| Y’know it’ll-it’ll be like my very own little sweatshop
Alice|0| 
Frank|0| Yeah, I’ve been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job
Frank|0|
Alice|0| No, Frank
Alice|0|
Phoebe|5| No you can’t quit college
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5| You’re in college
Phoebe|5| Really
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0| Yeah, refrigerator college
Frank|0|
Alice|0| Yeah
Alice|0|
Frank|0| Yeah, y’know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y’know I figured y’know like I should y’know have like a career—and I love refrigerators
Frank|0|
Phoebe|5| You can’t give up on your dream
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0| No, it’s okay
Frank|0| We’re-we’re gonna have three kids
Frank|0| And that’s-that’s a different kind of dream
Frank|0| Three kids and no money
Frank|0|
Ross|6| Emily
Ross|6| 
Emily|0| Oh my God
Emily|0| What are you doing here
Emily|0| 
Ross|6| I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off
Ross|6|
Emily|0| You are so sweet

Emily|0|  I’m only allowed one piece of carryon anyway
Emily|0| 
Ross|6|  Wait uh, listen

Ross|6| Umm, I’ve been thinking, I’m just gonna come out and say it
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6| I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you
Ross|6|
Emily|0| Oh
Emily|0|  Thank you
Emily|0| 
Ross|6| That’s no problem
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| What’s that song
Rachel|1| It has been in my head all day long
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| It’s the theme from Good Will Humping
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Y’know who doesn’t even like dirty movies
Rachel|1| My new boyfriend Joshua
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Yeah right
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| No, he told me
Rachel|1| He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Yes
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Yeah, he likes porn
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Where ya going
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| I’m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny
Rachel|1|  Hey, Pheebs
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Hey
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3|
Monica|2| How did it go with Frank and Alice
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies
Phoebe|5| I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you  about, ‘cause you work for a big company
Phoebe|5| Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| They don’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff
Chandler|4| I can get you some free white out though
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Ohh
Monica|2| Did you do what I said
Monica|2| Did-did-did you tell her
Monica|2|
Ross|6| I did
Ross|6|
Monica|2| And well, what did she say
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Thank you
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Oh, you’re totally welcome
Monica|2| What’d she say
Monica|2|
Ross|6|" She said, ""Thank you"
Ross|6|""" I said, ""I love you"
Ross|6|""" And she said, ""Thank you"
Ross|6|""""
Chandler|4| Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Ross|6| What do I do now
Ross|6|
Joey|3| You play hard to get
Joey|3|
Ross|6| She already lives in London
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Then you go to Tokyo
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| All right look, forget it, forget it
Chandler|4| You told her you love her, it’s over
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| It is not over
Monica|2| You’re over
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| What
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| You know
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4|  Good one
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you
Monica|2| And the reason why she couldn’t, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her
Monica|2| Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane
Monica|2| Come on now go
Monica|2| Go
Monica|2| 
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6| But if she doesn’t call, it is definitely over
Ross|6| No, wait
Ross|6| Wait
Ross|6| Unless, eventually, I call her, y’know just to she what’s going on, and, and she says she’ll call me back, but then she doesn’t
Ross|6| Then it’s over
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Way to be strong, man
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Hey
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Hi
Chandler|4| Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television
Chandler|4| We need a porn break
Chandler|4| We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5|  Ooh, good, you’re hear
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Hey
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Hi
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Well, what-what ‘cha got there
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Oh this, well I’m glad you asked
Phoebe|5|  Now, don’t you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife
Phoebe|5|  Ahh
Phoebe|5| Now, I know what you’re thinking…
Chandler|4| Pregnant Woman Slays Four
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Phoebe, they didn’t make you pay for those knives, did they
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Are you sure
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Honey, you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| What’s the second part of your plan
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| My Saturn dealership
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6|  Hello
Ross|6|
Emily|0| Ross
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Emily, hi
Ross|6| Uh, how-how was you flight
Ross|6|
Emily|0| It was dreadful
Emily|0| I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things
Emily|0|
Ross|6| No, no, that-that, that’s all right
Ross|6| Umm, I’m just glad you called
Ross|6|
Emily|0| Ross umm, there’s something that I’ve got to tell you, there’s-there’s someone else
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America
Ross|6|
Ross|6| She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy
Ross|6|
Monica|2| This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, there can’t be another guy
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Well…
Monica|2| Of course there’s another guy
Monica|2|
Monica|2| This is even more perfect
Monica|2| Now you have to prove your love
Monica|2|
Ross|6| I’m not proving anything
Ross|6| Okay, I’m done listening to you
Ross|6| If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would’ve put my fist through the wall
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| You put your fist through the wall
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| No, I missed and hit the door
Ross|6| But, it opened really hard
Ross|6|
Monica|2| You have to go to London
Monica|2|
Ross|6| What
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Yeah, you have to go fight for her
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3| ‘Cause you already told her you love her and she didn’t say it back, then she called you and told you that there’s another guy, so yeah, go to London that’ll scare her
Joey|3|
Monica|2| When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do
Monica|2|
Ross|6| I made fun of his accent
Ross|6|
Monica|2| You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all
Monica|2| Am I right
Monica|2| Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily
Monica|2|
Ross|6| No
Ross|6|
Monica|2| All right then, go fight for her
Monica|2| Go to London
Monica|2| I mean, that could be you and Emily
Monica|2|  That, but-but nicer
Monica|2| Just, go to London
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Really
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Come on
Monica|2| Surprise her
Monica|2| Show up at her doorstep
Monica|2| Don’t let her go without a fight
Monica|2|
Ross|6| All right
Ross|6| All right, I’m gonna do it
Ross|6| 
Monica|2| All right
Monica|2|
Ross|6| I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight for her
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Okay, good luck
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Ross
Joey|3| Ross
Joey|3| If you’re going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars
Joey|3| 
Rachel|1| Hey
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Ooh-Ooh
Phoebe|5| I did it
Phoebe|5| I did it
Phoebe|5| I figured out a way to make money
Phoebe|5| I’m gonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me
Phoebe|5| And
Phoebe|5| We can work it around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| That’s sounds great, but how are you going to afford it
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised…
Phoebe|5| I’m telling it
Phoebe|5| I’m telling it
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5| You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives
Phoebe|5| I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I’ve got
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| A place where no one will ever get out alive
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5| Think about it, it’s a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it’s…
Rachel|1|  Relaxi-Taxi
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| The name was my favourite part
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Well, well I can up with it
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| YOU DID NOT
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5| You came up with Relaxi Cab
Phoebe|5| That’s not good
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Well, I…
Monica|2| Hello
Monica|2|
Ross|6|  Hey
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Oh my God
Monica|2| Ross, are you in England
Monica|2| Was Emily surprised
Monica|2|
Ross|6| No, because she hasn’t come home yet
Ross|6| And she hasn’t been home all night
Ross|6| She’s obviously staying with that other guy, and I’m the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment
Ross|6|
Monica|2| All right
Monica|2| When is, when is the next flight out
Monica|2|
Ross|6| About four hours
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn’t show up by then, then just come on home
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that’s better than Relaxi Cab
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Okay, it’s not Relaxi Cab
Rachel|1| It’s Relaxicab, like taxicab
Rachel|1| 
Phoebe|5| Oh, that is better
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Are we in London
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| What are you doing here
Monica|2| You can’t be here
Monica|2|

Monica|2| I knew it
Monica|2|  I was right

Emily|0| I’d really rather talk to him
Emily|0| 
Monica|2| Oh
Monica|2|
Emily|0| I uh, I’ve been to his apartment and he wasn’t there, and uh
Emily|0| I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is
Emily|0|
Emily|0| Ross, are you there
Emily|0| Ross, I don’t know if you can hear this but…  I’m gonna talk anyway, uh, I’m in the States with you sister and your friends and it’s all over with Colin
Emily|0| I came here to tell you that, and to tell you—Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it
Emily|0| Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you
Emily|0|
Ross|6|  I love you too
Ross|6| I’m, I’m gonna call you right now from the phone booth
Ross|6|  You can’t hear me
Ross|6| 
Emily|0| I wish I could know if you’d heard any of that
Emily|0| I suppose I’ve either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh
Emily|0| Mrs
Emily|0| Newman if you’re listening, bugger off this in none of your business
Emily|0| I suppose there’s not much chance you did heard that, and there’s the call waiting so, I should go
Emily|0| Oh well
