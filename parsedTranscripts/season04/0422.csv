Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| That’s also like the tenth time you told us
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, oh I’m sorry, it must be really hard to hear
Phoebe|5| I tell ya, it’s a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder
Phoebe|5| I’m so sick of being pregnant
Phoebe|5| The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, ‘cause—Oh
Phoebe|5| I’m pregnant
Phoebe|5|

Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Oh, it’s awkward
Chandler|4| It’s awkward
Chandler|4| It’s awkward
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| I sort’ve already asked Chandler

Joey|3| He got to do it at your first wedding
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Joey, I figured you’d understand
Ross|6| I mean, I-I’ve known him a lot longer
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Come on Ross
Joey|3| Look, I-I don’t have any brothers; I’ll never get to be a best man
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| You can be the best man when I get married
Chandler|4|
Joey|3|  I’ll never get to be a best man
Joey|3|
Ross|6|  Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all
Ross|6|

Joey|3|
Joey|3| 
Phoebe|5| Hi, guys
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Hi
Rachel|1| Phoebe
Rachel|1| 
Monica|2| Hi Phoebe
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower
Phoebe|5| Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| No we…
Monica|2| Hormones
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| …hormones, yeah
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet
Phoebe|5| 
Monica|2| Wow, you seem to be doing so much better
Monica|2| That’s great
Monica|2| So how-how are things going
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Good
Phoebe|5| Y’know—no-no, okay, it’s-it feels like everything’s been about me lately, so what’s happening with you
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross’s wedding
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| It just might be too hard, given the history and all that…
Phoebe|5| Wow
Phoebe|5| This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Well, h-how is this like that
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Well, let’s see, it’s not
Phoebe|5| Really, like that
Phoebe|5| Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y’know a bunch of y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…
Rachel|1|  I’m-I’m sorry, I just thought that…
Phoebe|5| Alrighty, here come the water works
Phoebe|5| 
Joey|3| Ugh
Joey|3| I don’t know what I’m going to do
Joey|3| I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care
Joey|3| Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is
Joey|3|
Ross|6|  Hey guys
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Hey
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Hey…
Ross|6| I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party
Ross|6| And the guys from work had a blast
Ross|6| Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before
Ross|6| Yeah
Ross|6| And-and another one had never been to a party before, so…
Joey|3| So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh
Joey|3| Man, that’s nice
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Yeah, right
Ross|6|
Joey|3| I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those…
Ross|6| That ring
Ross|6| When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable
Chandler|4| 
Ross|6| Oh absolutely
Ross|6| It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| So you might say, it’s a magic ring
Chandler|4|
Joey|3|  Yeah, the stripper stole it
Joey|3|
Ross|6| My-my ring
Ross|6| My-my wedding ring
Ross|6| The-the stripper stole my wedding ring
Ross|6|
Ross|6| H-how
Ross|6|
Ross|6| How could this all happen
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Chandler|4|" Well, I think it all started when you said, ""Hey Joey, why don’t you be my best man"
Chandler|4|""""
Ross|6|  All right-all right, fine
Ross|6| I-I’m gonna call the cops
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Dude, I screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Not on you
Ross|6| On the stripper
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Oh, yeah, well I already did that
Joey|3| They said they’re gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Okay, well, we’ll call the company that sent her
Ross|6|
Joey|3| I did that too
Joey|3| They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number
Joey|3|" They said, ""If I bothered them again they’d call the police"
Joey|3|""" I said, ""If you talk to the police, you tell them I’m missing a ring"
Joey|3|""""
Ross|6| So what, Joey
Ross|6| Wh-wh-what
Ross|6| What are you telling me
Ross|6| That there’s nothing we can do
Ross|6| Well, how could this happen
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Look Ross, I am so-so sorry
Joey|3| I-I-I…
Chandler|4| Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Oh, that sounds like fun, but we’ve got a ring to find
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Here’s your tea Phoebe

Rachel|1| You what
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Oh my God
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Wait, you can’t have the baby here
Monica|2| I mean I haven’t sterilised it since the guys moved out
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1| It’s okay
Rachel|1| We’re gonna be okay
Rachel|1| Y’know what
Rachel|1| It’s okay
Rachel|1| I’m gonna, I’m gonna, I’m gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5| It’s all right; it’s probably false labour
Phoebe|5| They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Rachel, get the book
Monica|2| The book
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Okay

Joey|3|
The Stripper|0| Wait, you guys think I stole some ring
The Stripper|0|
Ross|6| We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess
Ross|6|
The Stripper|0| Okay, who are you
The Stripper|0| The Hardy boys
The Stripper|0| Look, I don’t need to steal some stupid ring, all right

The Stripper|0|
Chandler|4| Marry me
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3| I don’t get it
Joey|3| It was in my room all night
Joey|3| And if she didn’t take it, and I didn’t take it; and you  didn’t take it, then who did
Joey|3|  Shh
Joey|3| We’re trying to think
Joey|3| 
Rachel|1| I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Well, do you see any babies
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| How do you feel
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Okay, I guess
Phoebe|5| I mean… I don’t know, it’s just, I guess I know it’s going to be over soon
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Well, isn’t that a good thing
Rachel|1| You said you were sick of this
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| I know
Phoebe|5| It’s just y’know usually when you’re, when you’re done with the pregnant thing, y’know, then you get to do the mom thing
Phoebe|5| I’m gonna be y’know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Some moms do that
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Okay that’s even sadder
Phoebe|5| Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like, it’s like I know them y’know, I mean-I mean, it’s just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Aww, sweetie, but it’s not like you’re not gonna have anything
Monica|2| You’re gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that’s even better
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, okay
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| No, really
Rachel|1| Really, Pheebs, you’re not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they’re bad, y’know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down
Rachel|1| Y’know
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex
