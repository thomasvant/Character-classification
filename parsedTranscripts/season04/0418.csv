Chandler|4| Hey
Chandler|4| Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5|  Ha-ha
Phoebe|5|  No, it’s just I’m so pregnant that I—my guitar doesn’t fit anymore
Phoebe|5| So I thought ‘til I’m not, I’m just gonna play all my songs on this drum
Phoebe|5| It sounds really cool
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| All right
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Listen

Alice|0| JR
Alice|0| 
Chandler|4| Wouldn’t that be Frank the III
Chandler|4|
Alice|0| Don’t get me started
Alice|0|  Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby
Alice|0|
Phoebe|5| Wow
Phoebe|5| That’s so great
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5| Cougar
Phoebe|5|
Alice|0| You think about it
Alice|0| 
Emily|0| I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don’t think your son will think it’s yours and be horribly traumatised
Emily|0| 
Ross|6| Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra
Ross|6|
Emily|0|  Ohh, it’s time to go
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes

Ross|6| Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so…
Emily|0| Are you all right
Emily|0|
Susan|0| Oh, he’s fine
Susan|0| He’s fine
Susan|0| It’s just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn’t like me
Susan|0|

Phoebe|5| 
Chandler|4| Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name
Joey|3| How about, The Hulk
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5|" No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with ""The"
Phoebe|5|""""
Joey|3| Oh, want a good name, go with Joey
Joey|3| Joey’s your pal
Joey|3| Joey’s your buddy
Joey|3|" ""Where is everybody"
Joey|3|""" ""Well, they’re hanging out with Joey"
Joey|3|""""
Chandler|4| Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’re gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler
Chandler|4|  Oh, come on
Chandler|4| Chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he’s very loveable, once you get to know him
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too
Joey|3| But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he’ll be there
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Well, Chandler will be there for you too
Chandler|4| I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there
Chandler|4| And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you’re really hot
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| What do ya say
Joey|3| What do ya say
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names
Phoebe|5|  But, all right, I don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it
Joey|3| That’s what I wanted to name my kid
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing
Rachel|1| 
Monica|2| Y’know what
Monica|2| It really creeps me out choosing other people’s sex clothes
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Sorry

Rachel|1| 
Monica|2| Um-hmm
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| What am I making him by the way
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| I thought I was making him filet mignon
Rachel|1| 
Monica|2| Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant
Monica|2| And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Wow, I really get crabby when I cook
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Hey
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3|

Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| God, Susan is so fun
Phoebe|5|

Ross|6|" For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: ""My friend Susan is so smart"
Ross|6| My friend Susan is so funny
Ross|6| My friend Susan is so great
Ross|6|""""
Chandler|4| You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Hey, they’re going to the gym together
Ross|6| Two women
Ross|6| Stretching
Ross|6| Y’know they-they take a steam together
Ross|6| Things get a little playful—didn’t you see Personal Best
Ross|6|
Joey|3| No, but I’m gonna
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Hi
Chandler|4| Hi
Chandler|4| You’re crazy
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| This is Emily
Chandler|4| Emily is straight
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| How do you know
Ross|6| I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, I definitely
Phoebe|5| I don’t like the name Ross
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| What a weird way to kick me when I’m down
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5| I-I meant for the baby
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Oh
Ross|6| What’s wrong with Ross
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y’know…
Ross|6| Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No
Ross|6| 72, Dr
Ross|6| Bruce Banner found…  Y’know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend’s a lesbian
Ross|6| 
Phoebe|5| So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Oh
Joey|3| Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey
Joey|3| I mean, name one famous person named Chandler
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Raymond Chandler
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Someone you didn’t make up
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Okay, there are no famous Joey’s
Chandler|4| Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah, that guy really hurt us
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Well, how about a compromise then, okay
Phoebe|5| What if it’s like y’know, Chanoey
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Okay, look, Joey
Chandler|4| Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll never be President
Chandler|4| There’s never gonna be a President Joey
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life
Joey|3| It’s not even a name; it’s barely even a word
Joey|3| Okay
Joey|3| It’s kinda like chandelier, but it’s not
Joey|3| All right
Joey|3| It’s a stupid, stupid non-name
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Wow, you’re, you’re right
Chandler|4| I have a horrible, horrible name
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| I’m sorry man, I didn’t—I’m-I’m sorry
Joey|3| I’m sorry
Joey|3|  
Chandler|4| Okay

Joshua|0| Nothing I uh, it’s just that I know that they’re still out there
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| But, they’re across the hall
Rachel|1| I mean that’s two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Okay, that’s-that’s not funny
Joshua|0| Uhh
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else
Rachel|1| I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Oh, they’re working on this week, it’s a total mess
Joshua|0| But uh, I’m staying at my parents’ house, we could go there

Carol|0|
Ross|6| Uh-huh
Ross|6| Uh-huh

Ross|6|
Carol|0| What’s too much fun
Carol|0|
Ross|6| Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married

Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Carol|0| Yes

Carol|0| I can’t speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship
Carol|0|
Ross|6| Uh-huh, Carol, so were we
Ross|6| All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off
Ross|6| Y’know
Ross|6| Say-say they’re coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they’re laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else… There’s electricity, it’s new
Ross|6| It’s exciting
Ross|6| Are you telling me there isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening
Ross|6|
Carol|0| Maybe
Carol|0|
Ross|6| OH MY GOD
Ross|6|
Ross|6| I didn’t really believe it until you just said it
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Joshua|0| …and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Wow
Rachel|1| This place is fabulous
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Yeah, yeah, let me show you around
Joshua|0| This is the uh, downstairs living room
Joshua|0|

Joshua|0| Yeah, well, it would’ve been, but uh, my parents just moved here
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet
Rachel|1| Wanna make out
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Hey, here’s an idea
Joshua|0| Why don’t uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| That sounds like a plan
Rachel|1| Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up
Rachel|1|
Joshua|0| Oh yeah, yeah uh, it’s down the hall and uh, second door to your left
Joshua|0|
Rachel|1| Ah
Rachel|1|

Joey|3| Dude, I am sorry about what I said
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| It’s not that bad
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yes it is
Chandler|4| From now on, I have no first name
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| So, you’re just Bing
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| I have no name
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| All right, so, what are we supposed to call you
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Umm, Gene
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| It’s Clint
Chandler|4| It’s Clint
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3| See you later, Gene
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Bye, Gene

Joey|3| What’s up with Gene
Joey|3|
Monica|2| So, you wore your nightie to dinner
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Oh, yeah
Rachel|1| And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Oh my God
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Oh, no
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| No, it’s all right
Rachel|1| I got nice boobs
Rachel|1| 
Ross|6|  So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together
Ross|6| 
Rachel|1| So
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| So
Ross|6| Poetry
Ross|6| Susan’s gay
Ross|6| They’re being gay together
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Emily’s straight
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Oh, wake up
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Wow, Carol really messed you up
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Excuse me
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant
Phoebe|5|  All right, so I don’t know what sycophant means, but the rest is right
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Huh
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| What
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| She’s totally right
Rachel|1| When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| This totally makes sense
Monica|2|
Ross|6| It does not
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Oh, sure it does
Monica|2| In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then ’94 hit, Carol left him and bamn
Phoebe|5| Paranoid city
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Absolutely
Rachel|1| Absolutely
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| This is so much fun
Monica|2|
Ross|6| This is not fun
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5| The ’92 Ross wouldn’t
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| What—yeah—what, y’know what
Rachel|1| I hope Emily is a lesbian
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Drum roll
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4|  Okay
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| All right
Chandler|4| Help
Chandler|4| Am I a Mark, or a John
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| All right look, am I serious, okay
Chandler|4| Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| You’re actually going through with this
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life
Chandler|4| Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| You got problems because of you
Phoebe|5| Not your name
Phoebe|5| All right, this has got to stop
Phoebe|5| Chandler is a great name
Phoebe|5| In fact—yes,  I’m, I’m sorry
Phoebe|5| I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4|  Really
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, but you have to keep the name too
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| Thanks
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| You wanna hug it out
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| Yay
Phoebe|5| 
Chandler|4| Yay
Chandler|4| 
Phoebe|5| Yay—oh—yay
Phoebe|5| Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice
Phoebe|5| Right now
