Monica: Hey! Chandler: We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio. Phoebe: Oh, right! Your adoption interview! Monica: Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby. Joey: I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird! Chandler: And so incorrect! Monica: She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us. Ross: Come on, she's gonna love you guys! Chandler: Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up. Monica: And a lot could still get in our way. Chandler: Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better.. Phoebe: What are you gonna name the baby? Chandler: I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word. Joey: But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys? Monica: Oh my God. She's gonna pick us! Chandler: So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'? Monica: You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby! Chandler: Yes, but... Monica: Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and  you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY! {she leaves) Chandler: Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!  OPENING CREDITS   Rachel:  Hey, who's Phoebe with? Joey: I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with.   Hey! Phoebe: Hey! Joey: So... who's your friend? Phoebe: Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends! Joey: OW, why, why, why? Phoebe: Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists! Joey: Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with. Phoebe: Mandy. Joey: Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs? Phoebe: No. Joey: I know why I don't remember her, huh?  Rachel: Do you think I'm someone else? Joey: Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach? Rachel: Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else! Joey:  Growth! Phoebe: Fine, I'll give you her number. Joey: Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one.  Mandy. Phoebe: SARAH! Joey: Saraaah. Ross:  Hey! Rachel: Hi! Ross: Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice. Rachel: Oh! Ross:  How does this look? Rachel: Well, it's a little low... pick up a little...  a little bit more...  a little bit more...  There you go!  Now throw it away! Ross: C'mon! This looks good! Rachel: Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat. Ross: Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool! Phoebe: Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right? Ross: Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.  Joey: I can see why, nice shirt! Ross: You're wearing the same shirt. Joey: Stupid Gap on every corner!    Agency guy: Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica. Monica: Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK? Chandler: Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: ""Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"" Monica: Uh, we're gonna be great. Chandler: You're gonna be great. Monica: Well... obviously! Agency guy:  Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica. Monica: Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you. Erica:  Hi... Chandler: Thank you so much for agreeing to see us. Erica: Hi. Agency guy: I'll let you get acquainted. Chandler: Ok. Erica: So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D. Chandler: That's what our friends call us. Erica: Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating. Monica: I don't know about that. Erica: You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend? Chandler:  I don't think that's exactly... Monica:  Let her finish, doctor.    Phoebe: Hey! Joey: Hey. Phoebe: Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night. Joey: Well... Phoebe: Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back? Joey: Nope. Phoebe: What are you talking about? Sarah's great! Joey: Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok?  We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...   Phoebe: That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal! Joey: Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent. Phoebe: What? Joey: ALL FOOD! Phoebe: I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER! Joey: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!  Phoebe:  Oh Rachel: Hi Phoebe: Thank God you’re here. Listen to this! Rachel: what? Phoebe: Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries... Rachel: Oh! Oh, no!  Phoebe: What? You know about the plate thing? Rachel: Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ... Phoebe:  You wouldn’t let her have a grape? Rachel: Oh no! Not me! Emma!  Joey:  JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD! Phoebe: Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table! Joey:  I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks.  What were we talking about?   Phoebe:  This place is awesome! Ross: You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!   Rachel: Ah, this place is great! Phoebe: Wow! Ross: Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this!  Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair!  And nothing with padlocks on it! . Rachel: Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful! Ross:  Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars? Rachel: Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks! Ross: Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today. Phoebe : Hey, check this out! It’s totally you! Ross: Wow! Phoebe: Yeah!  Ross: Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys? Phoebe: What? They will be! Ross: All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here. Rachel: No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants... Ross: Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me. Rachel: Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you. Ross: Really? Rachel: Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you. Ross: So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers? Rachel:  Why do men keep talking to me like this?    Chandler: So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you? Erica: Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!” Monica: Amen. Chandler: Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor! Monica: Uh, good hands.  Healing hands. Erica: Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption? Monica: It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good. Erica: Wow. Chandler: Yeah, wow. Erica: I was wondering you both have such serious jobs.  Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock? Monica: Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock. Erica:  Being a doctor must take up a lot of time. Chandler: No-ot for me it doesn’t.  Agency guy: So, how’s everything going in here? Erica: We’re great, I think I may have asked all my questions. Agency guy: Do you have any question for Erica? Chandler: Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us? Agency guy: Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We’re very proud of it. Chandler: You should be. You’re really on top of stuff.. Agency guy:  Well, then if there’s nothing else, then the two of us should talk. Erica: Actually, I don’t think we have to. Monica: We don’t? Erica: Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. . I've made my decision. I choose them. Monica: Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that? Chandler: Yeah, I did. Monica:  Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!    Rachel: We got some really great stuff! Phoebe: Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got. Rachel: Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?  Phoebe: Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination? Rachel:  Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by     mistake, and one of mine is missing. Phoebe: oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.     Ross:  So? What do you think?  Joey: I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!! Ross:  Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here. Joey:  Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that. Ross: Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies? Joey:  Looks like someone IS the ladies!! Ross: You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me  I have a date.  See?  ALL eyes on ME!    Chandler: We are NOT signing those papers. Monica: Why not? Chandler: It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else. Monica: God works in mysterious ways. Chandler: You have gotta stop! Monica: But she liked us. Chandler: She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica. Monica: Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.  Chandler: Your Veal Chop is $34,95! Monica: C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now. Chandler: But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this? Monica:  Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us. Chandler: I know.. Monica: I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us? Chandler: oh, honey.. Monica:  Please.. please, we are so close. Chandler: Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.   Monica:  okay, right.  Chandler: So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us. Monica:  Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend? Chandler: You're Jewish. Monica: Technicality!   Waiter: A garden salad for the lady  Joey: Oh, that looks great! Good ordering! Waiter: Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy! Sarah: Mmmh, those fries look delicious. Joey: oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours.  Sarah:  Oh wow, are those stuffed clams? Joey: Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.  Joey: How about those fries though, huh?  Sarah: They are delicious  Joey:  You are beautiful, you know that? Sarah: Oh, that is so sweet.. Joey: Oh  okay..   Joey:  NOW look what you did!! Sarah: What? what is the matter with you? Joey: I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay? Sarah: But you just said ""What's mine is yours""? Joey: WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT! Sarah: Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal. Joey: I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean  There are things you do..and you now, things..  that you don't do .      Girl: Wow, this place looks great. Ross: Oh! You are gonna love it!  and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this. Girl: Me too!  Ross: Here  So this was fun!    Joey: I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you. Sarah: Sure  Just not as much as clams. Joey:  Well, stuffed clams.  Waiter: Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman. Joey: Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake. Waiter: Yes, that's Raspberry coule. Joey:  So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to     be healthy.  Sarah:  Oh my God!  Joey: Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead. Waiter: Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece. Sarah: Mmmm! Mmm!  Sarah: Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me? Joey: Oh yeah, sure. No problem.  Sarah: What are you doing? I thought you don't share food. Joey: Sure I do.  Coule? Sarah:  No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street. Joey:  Really? Sarah: Really! Now this all better be here when I come back.  Joey: Yeah, of course. I can control myself.   Joey:  Stop staring at me!  Joey: Why, just a tiny little...  Joey: Oh-oh! TIME LAPSE  Joey: I'm not even sorry.   Erica: Hi! Adoption Agency guy: Hey. Chandler: Hey. Agency guy: So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it. Monica:  I-Is... Is that a picture? Erica: Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it.  Monica: Look, doctor!  Look, before we sign anything we really have to talk... We're not who you think we are. Agency guy: I don't understand. Chandler: The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor. Erica: What? Agency guy: That's impossible. Chandler: I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like. Agency guy: I'll go check your file. Excuse me. Erica: So who are you? Chandler: Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York. Monica: Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.  Erica: So you lied to me before? Monica: Well, we...  ""bore false witness""... See I could be a reverend. Erica: I can't believe this.  Monica: But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider... Erica: Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this? Monica: Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file... Erica: I don't want to look at your file! This is over.  Chandler: Erica wait! Erica: I've nothing to say to you.  Chandler: You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again. Erica: Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it? Chandler: Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising. Erica: Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.  Chandler: But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?  Chandler: You still want that baby?  Monica: God bless you Chandler Bing! COMMERCIAL BREAK  Ross: Turns out this sweater is made for a woman. Joey:  So, why are you still wearing it? Ross: Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date? Joey: Ooh... Not so good. Ross: Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy? Joey: Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.  Joey:  JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!  end     "

They think we're somebody else. Monica: God works in mysterious ways. Chandler: You have gotta stop! Monica: But she liked us. Chandler: She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica. Monica: Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.  Chandler: Your Veal Chop is $34,95! Monica: C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now. Chandler: But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this? Monica:  Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us. Chandler: I know.. Monica: I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us? Chandler: oh, honey.. Monica:  Please.. please, we are so close. Chandler: Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.   Monica:  okay, right.  Chandler: So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us. Monica:  Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend? Chandler: You're Jewish. Monica: Technicality!   Waiter: A garden salad for the lady  Joey: Oh, that looks great! Good ordering! Waiter: Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy! Sarah: Mmmh, those fries look delicious. Joey: oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours.  Sarah:  Oh wow, are those stuffed clams? Joey: Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.  Joey: How about those fries though, huh?  Sarah: They are delicious  Joey:  You are beautiful, you know that? Sarah: Oh, that is so sweet.. Joey: Oh  okay..   Joey:  NOW look what you did!! Sarah: What? what is the matter with you? Joey: I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay? Sarah: But you just said ""What's mine is yours""? Joey: WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT! Sarah: Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal. Joey: I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean  There are things you do..and you now, things..  that you don't do .      Girl: Wow, this place looks great. Ross: Oh! You are gonna love it!  and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this. Girl: Me too!  Ross: Here  So this was fun!    Joey: I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you. Sarah: Sure  Just not as much as clams. Joey:  Well, stuffed clams.  Waiter: Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman. Joey: Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake. Waiter: Yes, that's Raspberry coule. Joey:  So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to     be healthy.  Sarah:  Oh my God!  Joey: Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead. Waiter: Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece. Sarah: Mmmm! Mmm!  Sarah: Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me? Joey: Oh yeah, sure. No problem.  Sarah: What are you doing? I thought you don't share food. Joey: Sure I do.  Coule? Sarah:  No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street. Joey:  Really? Sarah: Really! Now this all better be here when I come back.  Joey: Yeah, of course. I can control myself.   Joey:  Stop staring at me!  Joey: Why, just a tiny little...  Joey: Oh-oh! TIME LAPSE  Joey: I'm not even sorry.   Erica: Hi! Adoption Agency guy: Hey. Chandler: Hey. Agency guy: So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it. Monica:  I-Is... Is that a picture? Erica: Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it.  Monica: Look, doctor!  Look, before we sign anything we really have to talk... We're not who you think we are. Agency guy: I don't understand. Chandler: The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor. Erica: What? Agency guy: That's impossible. Chandler: I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like. Agency guy: I'll go check your file. Excuse me. Erica: So who are you? Chandler: Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York. Monica: Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.  Erica: So you lied to me before? Monica: Well, we...  ""bore false witness""... See I could be a reverend. Erica: I can't believe this.  Monica: But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider... Erica: Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this? Monica: Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file... Erica: I don't want to look at your file! This is over.  Chandler: Erica wait! Erica: I've nothing to say to you.  Chandler: You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again. Erica: Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it? Chandler: Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising. Erica: Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.  Chandler: But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?  Chandler: You still want that baby?  Monica: God bless you Chandler Bing! COMMERCIAL BREAK  Ross: Turns out this sweater is made for a woman. Joey:  So, why are you still wearing it? Ross: Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date? Joey: Ooh... Not so good. Ross: Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy? Joey: Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.  Joey:  JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!  end     "
Joey|Joey| Hey.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.
Joey|Joey| Well...
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?
Joey|Joey| Nope.
Phoebe|Phoebe| What are you talking about? Sarah's great!
Joey|Joey| Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok?  We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere... 
Phoebe|Phoebe| That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!
Joey|Joey| Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.
Phoebe|Phoebe| What?
Joey|Joey| ALL FOOD!
Phoebe|Phoebe| I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
Joey|Joey| Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!
Phoebe|Phoebe|  Oh
Rachel|Rachel| Hi
Phoebe|Phoebe| Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!
Rachel|Rachel| what?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
Rachel|Rachel| Oh! Oh, no!
Phoebe|Phoebe| What? You know about the plate thing?
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
Phoebe|Phoebe|  You wouldn’t let her have a grape?
Rachel|Rachel| Oh no! Not me! Emma!
Joey|Joey|  JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
Joey|Joey|  I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I’ll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks.  What were we talking about?
 Phoebe|Other|"  This place is awesome! Ross: You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!   Rachel: Ah, this place is great! Phoebe: Wow! Ross: Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this!  Nothing silver. . Ok? Nothing with hair!  And nothing with padlocks on it! . Rachel: Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful! Ross:  Wow, this is really soft . Three hundred and fifty dollars? Rachel: Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks! Ross: Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today. Phoebe : Hey, check this out!

And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you. Ross: So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers? Rachel:  Why do men keep talking to me like this?    Chandler: So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you? Erica: Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!” Monica: Amen. Chandler: Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor! Monica: Uh, good hands.  Healing hands. Erica: Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption? Monica: It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good. Erica: Wow. Chandler: Yeah, wow. Erica: I was wondering you both have such serious jobs.  Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock? Monica: Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock. Erica:  Being a doctor must take up a lot of time. Chandler: No-ot for me it doesn’t.  Agency guy: So, how’s everything going in here? Erica: We’re great, I think I may have asked all my questions. Agency guy: Do you have any question for Erica? Chandler: Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us? Agency guy: Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We’re very proud of it. Chandler: You should be. You’re really on top of stuff.. Agency guy:  Well, then if there’s nothing else, then the two of us should talk. Erica: Actually, I don’t think we have to. Monica: We don’t? Erica: Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. . I've made my decision. I choose them. Monica: Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that? Chandler: Yeah, I did. Monica:  Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!    Rachel: We got some really great stuff! Phoebe: Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got. Rachel: Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?  Phoebe: Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination? Rachel:  Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by     mistake, and one of mine is missing. Phoebe: oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.     Ross:  So? What do you think?  Joey: I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!! Ross:  Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here. Joey:  Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.

Chandler|Chandler| So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?
Erica|Other| Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!”
Monica|Monica| Amen.
Chandler|Chandler| Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
Monica|Monica| Uh, good hands.  Healing hands.
Erica|Other| Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?
Monica|Monica| It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
Erica|Other| Wow.
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, wow.
Erica|Other| I was wondering you both have such serious jobs.  Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
Monica|Monica| Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
Erica|Other|  Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.
Chandler|Chandler| No-ot for me it doesn’t.
Agency guy|Other| So, how’s everything going in here?
Erica|Other| We’re great, I think I may have asked all my questions.
Agency guy|Other| Do you have any question for Erica?
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
Agency guy|Other| Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We’re very proud of it.
Chandler|Chandler| You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..
Agency guy|Other|  Well, then if there’s nothing else, then the two of us should talk.
Erica|Other| Actually, I don’t think we have to.
Monica|Monica| We don’t?
Erica|Other| Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. . I've made my decision. I choose them.
Monica|Monica| Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, I did.
Monica|Monica|  Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. . You are SO going to Heaven!
 Rachel|Other| We got some really great stuff!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me? 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
Rachel|Rachel|  Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by     mistake, and one of mine is missing.
Phoebe|Phoebe| oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
Ross|Ross|  So? What do you think? 
Joey|Joey| I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
Ross|Ross|  Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
Joey|Joey|  Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
Ross|Ross| Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
Joey|Joey|  Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
Ross|Ross| You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me  I have a date.  See?  ALL eyes on ME!
Chandler|Chandler| We are NOT signing those papers.
Monica|Monica| Why not?
Chandler|Chandler| It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
Monica|Monica| God works in mysterious ways.
Chandler|Chandler| You have gotta stop!
Monica|Monica| But she liked us.
Chandler|Chandler| She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
Monica|Monica| Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor. 
Chandler|Chandler| Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
Monica|Monica| C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
Chandler|Chandler| But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
Monica|Monica|  Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
Chandler|Chandler| I know..
Monica|Monica| I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
Chandler|Chandler| oh, honey..
Monica|Monica|  Please.. please, we are so close.
Chandler|Chandler| Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.   Monica:  okay, right. 
Chandler|Chandler| So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
Monica|Monica|  Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
Chandler|Chandler| You're Jewish.
Monica|Monica| Technicality!
Waiter|Other| A garden salad for the lady 
Joey|Joey| Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!
Waiter|Other| Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!
Sarah|Other| Mmmh, those fries look delicious.
Joey|Joey| oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours. 
Sarah|Other|  Oh wow, are those stuffed clams?
Joey|Joey| Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.
Joey|Joey| How about those fries though, huh? 
Sarah|Other| They are delicious 
Joey|Joey|  You are beautiful, you know that?
Sarah|Other| Oh, that is so sweet..
Joey|Joey| Oh  okay.. 
Joey|Joey|  NOW look what you did!!
Sarah|Other| What? what is the matter with you?
Joey|Joey| I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?
Sarah|Other|" But you just said ""What's mine is yours""?"
Joey|Joey| WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!
Sarah|Other| Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal.
Joey|Joey| I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean  There are things you do..and you now, things..  that you don't do . 
Girl|Other| Wow, this place looks great.
Ross|Ross| Oh! You are gonna love it!  and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
Girl|Other| Me too! 
Ross|Ross| Here  So this was fun! 
Joey|Joey| I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.
Sarah|Other| Sure  Just not as much as clams.
Joey|Joey|  Well, stuffed clams.
Waiter|Other| Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.
Joey|Joey| Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
Waiter|Other| Yes, that's Raspberry coule.
Joey|Joey|  So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to     be healthy. 
Sarah|Other|  Oh my God! 
Joey|Joey| Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.
Waiter|Other| Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece.
Sarah|Other| Mmmm! Mmm!
Sarah|Other| Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?
Joey|Joey| Oh yeah, sure. No problem.
Sarah|Other| What are you doing? I thought you don't share food.
Joey|Joey| Sure I do.  Coule?
Sarah|Other|  No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street.
Joey|Joey|  Really?
Sarah|Other| Really! Now this all better be here when I come back. 
Joey|Joey| Yeah, of course. I can control myself. 
Joey|Joey|  Stop staring at me!
Joey|Joey| Why, just a tiny little...
Joey|Joey| Oh-oh!
Joey|Joey| I'm not even sorry.
Erica|Other| Hi!
Adoption Agency guy|Other| Hey.
Chandler|Chandler| Hey.
Agency guy|Other| So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it.
Monica|Monica|  I-Is... Is that a picture?
Erica|Other| Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it. 
Monica|Monica| Look, doctor!
Agency guy|Other| I don't understand.
Chandler|Chandler| The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
Erica|Other| What?
Agency guy|Other| That's impossible.
Chandler|Chandler| I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
Agency guy|Other| I'll go check your file. Excuse me.
Erica|Other| So who are you?
Chandler|Chandler| Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
Monica|Monica| Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby. 
Erica|Other| So you lied to me before?
Monica|Monica|" Well, we...  ""bore false witness""... See I could be a reverend."
Erica|Other| I can't believe this. 
Monica|Monica| But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
Erica|Other| Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?
Monica|Monica| Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
Erica|Other| I don't want to look at your file! This is over.
Chandler|Chandler| Erica wait!
Erica|Other| I've nothing to say to you. 
Chandler|Chandler| You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
Erica|Other| Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?
Chandler|Chandler| Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
Erica|Other| Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong. 
Chandler|Chandler| But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
Chandler|Chandler| You still want that baby?
Monica|Monica| God bless you Chandler Bing!
Ross|Ross| Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
Joey|Joey|  So, why are you still wearing it?
Ross|Ross| Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?
Joey|Joey| Ooh... Not so good.
Ross|Ross| Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
Joey|Joey| Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.
Joey|Joey|  JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
