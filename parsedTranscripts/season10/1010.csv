Final check by Kim   Monica:  Mmh... this cake is amazing! Rachel: My God, get a room! Monica: I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time! Phoebe: If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex? Monica:  Sex! Chandler:  Seriously, answer faster! Monica: Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said ""sex"" I wasn't thinking about ""sex with you""! Chandler:  It's like a giant hug. Phoebe: Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food? Ross: Food. Phoebe: Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs? Ross: Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice. Rachel: Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food? Joey: Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard. Rachel: No, you gotta pick one! Joey: Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!  OPENING CREDITS  Rachel: You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma. Phoebe: Oh, how cute! Rachel: Yeah. Phoebe: Oh, she looks just like a little doll! Rachel: Oh, no, no. That is a doll. Phoebe: Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy!  Look, there's Chandler.  Rachel: Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty. Phoebe: OH! He's having an affair. Rachel: He's not having an affair! Phoebe: You know, I'm always right about these things. Rachel: No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you! Phoebe: Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it!  See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her! Rachel: Oh, that doesn't mean anything. Phoebe: Oh yeah? Well, let's see.  Ok, duck down.   Chandler:  Hello. Phoebe: Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so... ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel. Chandler: Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day. Phoebe:  Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either ""Liar, Liar"" or ""Betrayal"", or... ""An Affair To Remember"". Chandler: Those are all really old! Phoebe: Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm... Rachel:  ""Dude, Where's My Car?""  Phoebe:  What? Rachel: They're in a caaar... Phoebe:  Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.  Rachel: Geez! Phoebe: Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them. Rachel: Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun. Phoebe:  I got them!   Chandler: Hi! Monica: Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.  Chandler: I was in the car with Nancy all day. Monica: Nancy doesn’t smoke! Chandler: Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that! Monica: So? What do you think of the house? Chandler: It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for. Monica: Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?  Chandler: And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?  What were the things you said? Monica: Don’t you love the huge yard? Chandler: And the fireplace in the bedroom. Monica: And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents! Chandler: This is bringing out a lovely color in you! Monica: So? Do you think we should get it? Chandler: I don’t know. What do you think? Monica: I think we should. Chandler: I do too. Monica: This is huge! Chandler: I know. Monica: How bad you wanna smoke, right now. Chandler: I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day. Monica: Gotcha. When do we tell them about this? Chandler: We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing. Monica: Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard. Chandler: I know. Gooooood luck with it.   Ross: I just can’t see Chandler cheating! Rachel: I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy! Joey: Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica! Ross: I know, and with the baby coming? Phoebe: So, should we tell her? Ross: I don’t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you? Phoebe: Why? Who’d you seen him with? Ross: No one, I’m just saying if...  Phoebe: TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW! Ross:  I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical! Phoebe: All right. . He is a good guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat. Ross: Believe me, if I did see with someone, there’s no way I...  Phoebe : WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?   Rachel: Oh, look at her, so happy! Monica: If only there were a smaller one to clean this one! Joey: Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here? Monica: No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up? Phoebe: Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you. Monica : All right... Ross: We think Chandler might be having an affair. Monica: What? Rachel: Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester. Phoebe: They went in together. So sorry. Monica: Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?  Phoebe: What? Joey:  Monica, you understand what we are saying, right? Monica: Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously...  Did you think the neighborhood was homey?  Chandler: Hey! Joey:  You son of a bitch! Chandler: Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here? Monica:  Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair. Rachel: Who's Nancy? Ross: What's going on? Monica:  Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big. Chandler: Yeah  I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor. Joey: I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!! Phoebe: Why do you have a realtor? Monica: Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city. Joey:  What? Rachel: Are you serious? Monica: When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city. Phoebe: So you're gonna move? Ross: Oh my God. Joey: Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?! Rachel: What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it! Monica: And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset... Chandler: ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by. Ross:  So you wanna buy a house in the 50's? Phoebe: Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door? Ross: You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay. Joey: No, no, it's not, don't listen to him!  I'm gonna thump you!  Ross:  It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.  Chandler: Actually, we already found a house we love. Ross: What? Monica: And about an hour ago, we made an offer.  Chandler: Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh? TIME LAPSE Ross: You put an offer on a house?  Monica:  It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees...  Phoebe: Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers? Chandler: I know this is really hard and we're really sorry. Joey: Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food?  Because I can stop doing that,  I really, really think I can!  Chandler:  You know that's not the reason Joe.  Monica: We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there.  It is beautiful, isn't it? Rachel: Yeah it is. Joey: What the hell are you doin'? Rachel: Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live! Phoebe: Yeah, but so is this. Ross: Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?    Rachel:  C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy! Ross: You can see where he'd have trouble. Rachel: Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.  Monica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...   Ross: That money is mine, Green! Rachel: You're fly is open, Geller! Phoebe: You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence? Chandler: Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!   Phoebe:  Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.  Rachel: Ow, that had to hurt!   Phoebe: Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help. The Guys: We will.  Monica: Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles. Rachel: No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.   Monica: Every year.   Joey:  It's stuck!!! Phoebe:  Easy. Step. How did it get on? Joey: I put it on to scare Chandler! Phoebe: Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out! Joey: It smells really bad in here. Phoebe: Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!  Monica: Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God!  Who is that? Joey: It's Joey.   Monica: I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster? Rachel: Oooohh that’s interesting. Chandler: If you win, we give up the birds. Joey:  Dah!!  Chandler: But if we win, we get your apartment. Joey: Oooooh! Monica: Deal! TIME LAPSE Ross: What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie? Joey: Big fat goalie. Ross: Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie… Chandler: Dangerous Liaisons. Ross: Correct. Her actual favorite movie is... Joey: Weekend at Bernie’s. Ross: Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?  Joey: Everyday use. Chandler: Fancy. Joey: Guest. Chandler: Fancy guest. Ross: Two seconds... Joey: Uhh, 11! Ross: 11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.   Ross:  Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast? Rachel: 14? Ross: No, 19. Chandler: Thanks man. Ross: Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was? Monica: Maurice. Ross: Correct, his profession was? Rachel: Space cowboy! Ross: Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?  Rachel: Ow...Oh Gosh! Ross: 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game. Monica: It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding. Rachel: Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster! Monica: That’s not even a word!  Monica: NOOOOOOOOO!!!!! TIME LAPSE  Rachel: Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean! Joey: Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes! Rachel: That is not true. She did! She forced me! Monica: Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong! Rachel: Well it stupid, unfair question! Ross: Don’t blame the questions! Chandler: Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!   Ross: Chandler!!! Chandler!!!  Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here! Chandler:  Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!  Monica:  Hey Ross. What's up bro?  Ross: What the hell are doing?!! Rachel:  Hey, what's-what's going on?! Chandler: Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica. Joey:  Dude! He's right there! Ross:  I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this! Chandler: Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her. Monica: I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.  Ross:  My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.     Monica: Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, ""What were you thinking?"" Rachel: Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler. Phoebe: Ok, you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore. Monica and Rachel: What?! Phoebe: You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you! Rachel: Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving. Monica: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like. Phoebe: What else? Monica: When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror. Rachel: Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that. Phoebe: That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom. Monica: When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket. Rachel: Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold. Monica: And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.   You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!  TIME LAPSE  Chandler:  Hey. Monica: She really left. Chandler: I know.  Monica: Thank you. Chandler: No problem roomie.  Monica: Can I ask you a question? Chandler: Sure! Monica: What the hell is that dog doing here?!    Chandler: Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked. All: That's so sweet. Ross: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas. Rachel: And a crappy New Year. Chandler: Here, here!   Rachel: You can't move. You just... you just can't. Joey: Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.  Phoebe: Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters. Ross: You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good.  Rachel: Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.  Chandler: Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer. Monica: And?  Chandler:  Okay, thanks...  They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price. Monica: We can't afford that. Chandler: I know. Monica: Well, there you go.  Joey: I'm really sorry you guys. Ross: Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window. Rachel: Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone. Phoebe:  You're gonna be okay? Monica: Yeah, we'll be okay. Ross: Love you guys.  Joey: You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before. Chandler: That's okay, we understand. Joey: And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?  Monica: I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much. Chandler: Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then. Monica: What? Chandler: We got the house. Monica: Oh my God! Chandler: I just didn't want to tell you in front of them. Monica: Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !? Chandler: We're getting the house.  We're getting the house. Monica: And a baby... Chandler: We're growing up. Monica: We sure are. Chandler: So who's gonna tell them? Monica:  Not it! Chandler: Not it! Damn it! COMMERCIAL BREAK   Monica: Rachel, this is yours. Rachel: Aah! Why? What are these for? Chandler: You'll see. Monica: All right, everybody open them!  Rachel: Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful.  Phoebe: Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store.  Monica: I know. Ross: I love this.  Joey: A meatball Sub? Thanks!  Ross: Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for? Chandler: Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house. Monica: Enjoy!  Joey:  What did they say? THE END   "

Monica: It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding. Rachel: Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster! Monica: That’s not even a word!  Monica: NOOOOOOOOO!!!!! TIME LAPSE  Rachel: Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean! Joey: Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes! Rachel: That is not true. She did! She forced me! Monica: Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong! Rachel: Well it stupid, unfair question! Ross: Don’t blame the questions! Chandler: Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!   Ross: Chandler!!! Chandler!!!  Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here! Chandler:  Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then!  Monica:  Hey Ross. What's up bro?  Ross: What the hell are doing?!! Rachel:  Hey, what's-what's going on?! Chandler: Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica. Joey:  Dude! He's right there! Ross:  I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this! Chandler: Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her. Monica: I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.  Ross:  My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.     Monica: Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, ""What were you thinking?"" Rachel: Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler. Phoebe: Ok, you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore. Monica and Rachel: What?! Phoebe: You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you! Rachel: Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving. Monica: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like. Phoebe: What else? Monica: When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror. Rachel: Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that. Phoebe: That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom. Monica: When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket. Rachel: Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold. Monica: And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.   You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!  TIME LAPSE  Chandler:  Hey. Monica: She really left. Chandler: I know.  Monica: Thank you. Chandler: No problem roomie.  Monica: Can I ask you a question? Chandler: Sure! Monica: What the hell is that dog doing here?!    Chandler: Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked. All: That's so sweet. Ross: And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas. Rachel: And a crappy New Year. Chandler: Here, here!   Rachel: You can't move. You just... you just can't. Joey: Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.  Phoebe: Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters. Ross: You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good.  Rachel: Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.  Chandler: Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer. Monica: And?  Chandler:  Okay, thanks...  They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price. Monica: We can't afford that. Chandler: I know. Monica: Well, there you go.  Joey: I'm really sorry you guys. Ross: Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window. Rachel: Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone. Phoebe:  You're gonna be okay? Monica: Yeah, we'll be okay. Ross: Love you guys.  Joey: You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before. Chandler: That's okay, we understand. Joey: And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?  Monica: I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much. Chandler: Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then. Monica: What? Chandler: We got the house. Monica: Oh my God! Chandler: I just didn't want to tell you in front of them. Monica: Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !? Chandler: We're getting the house.  We're getting the house. Monica: And a baby... Chandler: We're growing up. Monica: We sure are. Chandler: So who's gonna tell them? Monica:  Not it! Chandler: Not it! Damn it! COMMERCIAL BREAK   Monica: Rachel, this is yours. Rachel: Aah! Why? What are these for? Chandler: You'll see. Monica: All right, everybody open them!  Rachel: Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful.  Phoebe: Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store.  Monica: I know. Ross: I love this.  Joey: A meatball Sub? Thanks!  Ross: Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for? Chandler: Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house. Monica: Enjoy!  Joey:  What did they say? THE END   "
 Monica|0|  Mmh... this cake is amazing!
Rachel|1| My God, get a room!
Monica|2| I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!
Phoebe|5| If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
Monica|2|  Sex!
Chandler|4|  Seriously, answer faster!
Monica|2|" Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said ""sex"" I wasn't thinking about ""sex with you""!"
Chandler|4|  It's like a giant hug.
Phoebe|5| Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?
Ross|6| Food.
Phoebe|5| Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
Ross|6| Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
Rachel|1| Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?
Joey|3| Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.
Rachel|1| No, you gotta pick one!
Joey|3| Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!
Rachel|1| You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.
Phoebe|5| Oh, how cute!
Rachel|1| Yeah.
Phoebe|5| Oh, she looks just like a little doll!
Rachel|1| Oh, no, no. That is a doll.
Phoebe|5| Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy!  Look, there's Chandler. 
Rachel|1| Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.
Phoebe|5| OH! He's having an affair.
Rachel|1| He's not having an affair!
Phoebe|5| You know, I'm always right about these things.
Rachel|1| No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!
Phoebe|5| Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it!  See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!
Rachel|1| Oh, that doesn't mean anything.
Phoebe|5| Oh yeah? Well, let's see.  Ok, duck down.  
Chandler|4|  Hello.
Phoebe|5| Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so... ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
Chandler|4| Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
Phoebe|5|"  Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either ""Liar, Liar"" or ""Betrayal"", or... ""An Affair To Remember""."
Chandler|4| Those are all really old!
Phoebe|5| Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...
Rachel|1|"  ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" "
Phoebe|5|  What?
Rachel|1| They're in a caaar...
Phoebe|5|  Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye. 
Rachel|1| Geez!
Phoebe|5| Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
Rachel|1| Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.
Phoebe|5|  I got them!
Chandler|4| Hi!
Monica|2| Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes. 
Chandler|4| I was in the car with Nancy all day.
Monica|2| Nancy doesn’t smoke!
Chandler|4| Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!
Monica|2| So? What do you think of the house?
Chandler|4| It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.
Monica|2| Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic? 
Chandler|4| And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?  What were the things you said?
Monica|2| Don’t you love the huge yard?
Chandler|4| And the fireplace in the bedroom.
Monica|2| And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
Chandler|4| This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
Monica|2| So? Do you think we should get it?
Chandler|4| I don’t know. What do you think?
Monica|2| I think we should.
Chandler|4| I do too.
Monica|2| This is huge!
Chandler|4| I know.
Monica|2| How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
Chandler|4| I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.
Monica|2| Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
Chandler|4| We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.
Monica|2| Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
Chandler|4| I know. Gooooood luck with it.
Ross|6| I just can’t see Chandler cheating!
Rachel|1| I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
Joey|3| Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!
Ross|6| I know, and with the baby coming?
Phoebe|5| So, should we tell her?
Ross|6| I don’t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?
Phoebe|5| Why? Who’d you seen him with?
Ross|6| No one, I’m just saying if... 
Phoebe|5| TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
Ross|6|  I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!
Phoebe|5| All right. . He is a good guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat.
Ross|6| Believe me, if I did see with someone, there’s no way I... 
Phoebe |0| WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?
Rachel|1| Oh, look at her, so happy!
Monica|2| If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
Joey|3| Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?
Monica|2| No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?
Phoebe|5| Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you.
Monica |0| All right...
Ross|6| We think Chandler might be having an affair.
Monica|2| What?
Rachel|1| Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.
Phoebe|5| They went in together. So sorry.
Monica|2| Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?
Phoebe|5| What?
Joey|3|  Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
Monica|2| Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously...  Did you think the neighborhood was homey? 
Chandler|4| Hey!
Joey|3|  You son of a bitch!
Chandler|4| Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
Monica|2|  Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
Rachel|1| Who's Nancy?
Ross|6| What's going on?
Monica|2|  Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
Chandler|4| Yeah  I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
Joey|3| I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
Phoebe|5| Why do you have a realtor?
Monica|2| Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
Joey|3|  What?
Rachel|1| Are you serious?
Monica|2| When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
Phoebe|5| So you're gonna move?
Ross|6| Oh my God.
Joey|3| Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
Rachel|1| What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
Monica|2| And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
Chandler|4| ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
Ross|6|  So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
Phoebe|5| Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
Ross|6| You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
Joey|3| No, no, it's not, don't listen to him!  I'm gonna thump you! 
Ross|6|  It's ok, because they have to get it out of their system, okay , but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
Chandler|4| Actually, we already found a house we love.
Ross|6| What?
Monica|2| And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
Chandler|4| Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?
Ross|6| You put an offer on a house? 
Monica|2|  It's so sweet. It really is. It has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there's these old maple trees... 
Phoebe|5| Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?
Chandler|4| I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
Joey|3| Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food?  Because I can stop doing that,  I really, really think I can! 
Chandler|4|  You know that's not the reason Joe. 
Monica|2| We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there.  It is beautiful, isn't it?
Rachel|1| Yeah it is.
Joey|3| What the hell are you doin'?
Rachel|1| Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!
Phoebe|5| Yeah, but so is this.
Ross|6| Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
Rachel|1|  C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Ross|6| You can see where he'd have trouble.
Rachel|1| Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. 
Monica|2| Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Ross|6| That money is mine, Green!
Rachel|1| You're fly is open, Geller!
Phoebe|5| You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Chandler|4| Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
Phoebe|5|  Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Rachel|1| Ow, that had to hurt!
Phoebe|5| Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
The Guys|0| We will. 
Monica|2| Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
Rachel|1| No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this. 
Monica|2| Every year.
Joey|3|  It's stuck!!!
Phoebe|5|  Easy. Step. How did it get on?
Joey|3| I put it on to scare Chandler!
Phoebe|5| Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Joey|3| It smells really bad in here.
Phoebe|5| Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
Monica|2| Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God!  Who is that?
Joey|3| It's Joey.
Monica|2| I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Rachel|1| Oooohh that’s interesting.
Chandler|4| If you win, we give up the birds.
Joey|3|  Dah!! 
Chandler|4| But if we win, we get your apartment.
Joey|3| Oooooh!
Monica|2| Deal!
Ross|6| What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Joey|3| Big fat goalie.
Ross|6| Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…
Chandler|4| Dangerous Liaisons.
Ross|6| Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
Joey|3| Weekend at Bernie’s.
Ross|6| Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Joey|3| Everyday use.
Chandler|4| Fancy.
Joey|3| Guest.
Chandler|4| Fancy guest.
Ross|6| Two seconds...
Joey|3| Uhh, 11!
Ross|6| 11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.  
Ross|6|  Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
Rachel|1| 14?
Ross|6| No, 19.
Chandler|4| Thanks man.
Ross|6| Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Monica|2| Maurice.
Ross|6| Correct, his profession was?
Rachel|1| Space cowboy!
Ross|6| Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
Rachel|1| Ow...Oh Gosh!
Ross|6| 10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
Monica|2| It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.
Rachel|1| Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!
Monica|2| That’s not even a word!
Monica|2| NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Rachel|1| Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Joey|3| Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Rachel|1| That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Monica|2| Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!
Rachel|1| Well it stupid, unfair question!
Ross|6| Don’t blame the questions!
Chandler|4| Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Ross|6| Chandler!!! Chandler!!!  Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
Chandler|4|  Wow! Listen, we had a good run. You know, what was it? Four? Five months? I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime! So, good-bye, take care, bye-bye then! 
Monica|2|  Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Ross|6| What the hell are doing?!!
Rachel|1|  Hey, what's-what's going on?!
Chandler|4| Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Joey|3|  Dude! He's right there!
Ross|6|  I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
Chandler|4| Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Monica|2| I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
Ross|6|  My best friend and my sister! I cannot believe this.  
Monica|2|" Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, ""What were you thinking?"""
Rachel|1| Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Phoebe|5| Ok, you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.
Monica|2| What?!
Rachel|1| What?!
Phoebe|5| You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Rachel|1| Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
Monica|2| Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.
Phoebe|5| What else?
Monica|2| When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Rachel|1| Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
Phoebe|5| That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Monica|2| When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
Rachel|1| Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.
Monica|2| And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.   You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! 
Chandler|4|  Hey.
Monica|2| She really left.
Chandler|4| I know. 
Monica|2| Thank you.
Chandler|4| No problem roomie. 
Monica|2| Can I ask you a question?
Chandler|4| Sure!
Monica|2| What the hell is that dog doing here?! 
Chandler|4| Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
All|0| That's so sweet.
Ross|6| And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Rachel|1| And a crappy New Year.
Chandler|4| Here, here!
Rachel|1| You can't move. You just... you just can't.
Joey|3| Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong. 
Phoebe|5| Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
Ross|6| You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good. 
Rachel|1| Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.
Chandler|4| Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
Monica|2| And?
Chandler|4|  Okay, thanks...  They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
Monica|2| We can't afford that.
Chandler|4| I know.
Monica|2| Well, there you go.
Joey|3| I'm really sorry you guys.
Ross|6| Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
Rachel|1| Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.
Phoebe|5|  You're gonna be okay?
Monica|2| Yeah, we'll be okay.
Ross|6| Love you guys. 
Joey|3| You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
Chandler|4| That's okay, we understand.
Joey|3| And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
Monica|2| I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
Chandler|4| Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
Monica|2| What?
Chandler|4| We got the house.
Monica|2| Oh my God!
Chandler|4| I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
Monica|2| Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
Chandler|4| We're getting the house.  We're getting the house.
Monica|2| And a baby...
Chandler|4| We're growing up.
Monica|2| We sure are.
Chandler|4| So who's gonna tell them?
Monica|2|  Not it!
Chandler|4| Not it! Damn it!
Monica|2| Rachel, this is yours.
Rachel|1| Aah! Why? What are these for?
Chandler|4| You'll see.
Monica|2| All right, everybody open them!
Rachel|1| Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful. 
Phoebe|5| Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store. 
Monica|2| I know.
Ross|6| I love this. 
Joey|3| A meatball Sub? Thanks! 
Ross|6| Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
Chandler|4| Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.
Monica|2| Enjoy!
Joey|3|  What did they say?
