Ross| And here's little Ben nodding off...
Monica| Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
Phoebe| Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
Rachel| Oh, let me see!  Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
Ross|  That would be nice.
Rachel| Pardon?
Chandler| Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. 
Joey| Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Chandler| Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
Joey| I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
Chandler| ... And where's this money coming from? 
Joey| Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
Ross|  What kind of research?
Joey| Oh, just, y'know.... science.
Ross| Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. 
Joey| ... It's a fertility study.
Monica| Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Joey| Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
Ross| Hey.
Phoebe| Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
Monica| OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
Phoebe| We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew... 
Chandler|  Men are here.
Joey| We make fire. Cook meat.
Chandler| Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Monica| Ewww!
Phoebe| Ewww!
Monica| Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
Joey| Oh, OK.
Phoebe| So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your  special someone?
Joey| I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Monica| Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
Joey| What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Monica| Man's got a point.
Joey| Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Chandler| Crazy bitch.
Joey| Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Monica| Joey... we always know what you mean.
Phoebe| Hey.
Monica| Hey.
Ross| Hey. 
Phoebe| How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
Ross| I'm going to China. 
Phoebe| Jeez, you say one thing, and...
Monica| You're going to China?
Ross| Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo—it's—it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me... 
Phoebe| Oh, let me see! 
Ross| : Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
Monica| Yeah.
Phoebe| Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh....  Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Ross| Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
Monica| Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
Ross| Oh.  Hey, who's Carl?
Monica| You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
Ross| No.
Phoebe| Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
Ross| At the coffeehouse, right.
Phoebe| So you do know who he is!  Sorry.
Ross| OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
Phoebe| Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
Ross| Hi.
Joey| Hey!
Chandler| Hey!
Ross| ....I have to go to China.
Joey| The country?
Ross| No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
Chandler| Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Ross| Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Joey| Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
Chandler| Forget about her.
Joey| He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Chandler| Course there, they just call it food.
Ross| Yeah... I guess. I don't—I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? 
Joey| Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
Ross| I know.
Joey| We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. 
Chandler| I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
Melanie| Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
Joey| Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
Chandler|  Ooooh. 
Monica|  OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Rachel| Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. 
Monica| Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Joey| Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
Joey| Then you do. Heh, heh.
Monica| So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
Joey| What do you mean?
Monica| Y'know, just be there for her.
Joey| Not following you.
Monica| Think about it.
Rachel| OK, I'm guessing this is from...
Rachel| Well, thank you, Melanie.
Chandler|  OK, this one right here is from me.
Rachel|  OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's...  Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! 
Rachel| This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And......it's a book!
Phoebe| Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
Joey| : That book got me through some tough times.
Melanie| There is a little child inside this man!
Chandler| Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Rachel| Who's this from?
Chandler| Oh, that's Ross's. 
Rachel| Oh... ...  Oh my God. He remembered.
Phoebe| Remembered what?
Rachel| It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Chandler| Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? 
Phoebe| Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Monica| I can't believe he did this.
Chandler| Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
Rachel| What did you just say?
Chandler|  ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Rachel| No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
Chandler|  F-hah.... flennin....
Rachel| Oh.... my God.
Chandler|  Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
Joey|  That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
Rachel| I mean, this is unbelievable.
Phoebe| I know. This is really, really huge.
Chandler| No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Phoebe| Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
Chandler| OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
Monica| I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Rachel| No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
Joey| Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
Rachel| Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. 
Chandler|  H-He's in China!
Joey| The country.
Monica| No, no, wait.  His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
Chandler| What about the time difference?
Monica| From here to the airport?
Chandler| Yes!  You're never gonna make it!
Monica| Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
Rachel| I-I-I don't know.
Chandler| Well then maybe you shouldn't go. 
Joey| He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
Monica| Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
Rachel| I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
Phoebe| Here, look, alright, does this help?
Rachel| Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later. 
Chandler| Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! 
Ross| 
Flight Attendant| Alright!
Ross| Ni-chou chi-ma! 
Rachel| Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
Flight Attendant| Hi!
Rachel| Hi.
Flight Attendant| May I see your boarding pass?
Rachel| Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Flight Attendant| Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
Rachel| No, I know, but I—he just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
Flight Attendant| No no no! Federal regulations!
Rachel| OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
Flight Attendant| Alright. What's the message?
Rachel| Uh... I don't know.
Flight Attendant| Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
Man|  What?
Flight Attendant| It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
Man| : Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
Melanie| Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
Joey| Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Melanie| Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! 
Joey|  Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
Melanie|  M-Me again?
Joey| Sure! Why not?
Melanie| Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
Melanie| Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
Joey| How do you mean?
Melanie| I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
Monica| Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
Rachel| I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
Monica| Sure.
Phoebe| Sure.
Rachel| I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Monica| Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Phoebe| Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
Monica| Another good point.
Phoebe| No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
Rachel|  Huh?
Phoebe| Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Monica| Why isn't it working out?
Rachel| I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Monica| Is he not cute enough for you?
Rachel| No!
Monica| Does he not make enough money?
Rachel| No, I'm just....
Phoebe| Maybe there's someone else.
Rachel| Wha...
Monica| Is there? Is there someone else?
Rachel| No! There is.. there is noone else!
Monica| Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
Chandler| Hey, big...
Joey| Shhhh!
Chandler|  ...spender.
Joey| She's still asleep.
Chandler| So how'd it go?
Joey| Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
Chandler| The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Joey| Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Chandler| Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
Joey| It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Chandler| I didn't know you had another level.
Joey| I know! Neither did I!
Monica| Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
Rachel| Yeah.
Monica| Oh, from who?
Rachel| From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Monica| Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
Rachel| Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this—this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Monica| Oh, why?
Rachel| Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
Monica|  No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Rachel| Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
Monica| I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
Rachel| Who is it?
Intercom| It's me, Carl.
Rachel| C'mon up.
Monica| Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Joey| Seven hundred bucks!
Chandler| Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Joey| Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Chandler| Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Joey| What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? 
Carl| I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
Ross| I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Rachel| Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
Ross| Fine, just stop thinking about me.
Ross| Can't do it, can you?
Rachel| So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Ross| I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Rachel| Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
Carl| I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
Ross| Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Rachel| Ross, it's too hard.
Ross| No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade. 
Rachel| Ross, you're like my best friend.
Ross| I know.
Rachel| If we broke up, and I lost you...
Ross| Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Rachel| Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Ross|  No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
Rachel| I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Ross| Well, start looking. 
Rachel| Wow.
Carl| Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
Rachel| Right! You're right!
Carl| Heh... y'know?
Rachel| You know what?
Carl| What?
Rachel| I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do....  I mean—I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry. 
Carl| But...
Rachel|  Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
Man| For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
Ross| Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
Julie| Oh, thanks, sweetie.
Ross| No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Julie| Really?
Ross| Yeah. 
Julie| You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
Ross| No, no, they will. I just... uh...
Ross| Can't wait.
Julie| Can't wait.
Ross| Come on, they're gonna love you.
