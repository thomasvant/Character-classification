Ross|Ross| And here's little Ben nodding off...
Monica|Monica| Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, let me see!  Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!
Ross|Ross|  That would be nice.
Rachel|Rachel| Pardon?
Chandler|Chandler| Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. 
Joey|Joey| Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars.
Joey|Joey| I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.
Chandler|Chandler| ... And where's this money coming from? 
Joey|Joey| Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research.
Ross|Ross|  What kind of research?
Joey|Joey| Oh, just, y'know.... science.
Ross|Ross| Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. 
Joey|Joey| ... It's a fertility study.
Monica|Monica| Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.
Joey|Joey| Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars.
Ross|Ross| Hey.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
Monica|Monica| OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...
Phoebe|Phoebe| We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew... 
Chandler|Chandler|  Men are here.
Joey|Joey| We make fire. Cook meat.
Chandler|Chandler| Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.
Monica|Monica| Ewww!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Ewww!
Monica|Monica| Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.
Joey|Joey| Oh, OK.
Phoebe|Phoebe| So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your  special someone?
Joey|Joey| I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Monica|Monica| Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
Joey|Joey| What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Monica|Monica| Man's got a point.
Joey|Joey| Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Chandler|Chandler| Crazy bitch.
Joey|Joey| Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Monica|Monica| Joey... we always know what you mean.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Hey.
Monica|Monica| Hey.
Ross|Ross| Hey. 
Phoebe|Phoebe| How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
Ross|Ross| I'm going to China. 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Jeez, you say one thing, and...
Monica|Monica| You're going to China?
Ross|Ross| Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo—it's—it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me... 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, let me see! 
Ross|Ross| : Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
Monica|Monica| Yeah.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh....  Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Ross|Ross| Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
Monica|Monica| Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
Ross|Ross| Oh.  Hey, who's Carl?
Monica|Monica| You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse.
Ross|Ross| No.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...
Ross|Ross| At the coffeehouse, right.
Phoebe|Phoebe| So you do know who he is!  Sorry.
Ross|Ross| OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.
Ross|Ross| Hi.
Joey|Joey| Hey!
Chandler|Chandler| Hey!
Ross|Ross| ....I have to go to China.
Joey|Joey| The country?
Ross|Ross| No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
Chandler|Chandler| Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Ross|Ross| Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Joey|Joey| Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
Chandler|Chandler| Forget about her.
Joey|Joey| He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Chandler|Chandler| Course there, they just call it food.
Ross|Ross| Yeah... I guess. I don't—I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? 
Joey|Joey| Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
Ross|Ross| I know.
Joey|Joey| We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. 
Chandler|Chandler| I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
Melanie|Other| Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
Joey|Joey| Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
Chandler|Chandler|  Ooooh. 
Monica|Monica|  OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. 
Monica|Monica| Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Joey|Joey| Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
Joey|Joey| Then you do. Heh, heh.
Monica|Monica| So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
Joey|Joey| What do you mean?
Monica|Monica| Y'know, just be there for her.
Joey|Joey| Not following you.
Monica|Monica| Think about it.
Rachel|Rachel| OK, I'm guessing this is from...
Rachel|Rachel| Well, thank you, Melanie.
Chandler|Chandler|  OK, this one right here is from me.
Rachel|Rachel|  OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's...  Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! 
Rachel|Rachel| This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And......it's a book!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
Joey|Joey| : That book got me through some tough times.
Melanie|Other| There is a little child inside this man!
Chandler|Chandler| Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Rachel|Rachel| Who's this from?
Chandler|Chandler| Oh, that's Ross's. 
Rachel|Rachel| Oh... ...  Oh my God. He remembered.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Remembered what?
Rachel|Rachel| It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Chandler|Chandler| Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Monica|Monica| I can't believe he did this.
Chandler|Chandler| Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
Rachel|Rachel| What did you just say?
Chandler|Chandler|  ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Rachel|Rachel| No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
Chandler|Chandler|  F-hah.... flennin....
Rachel|Rachel| Oh.... my God.
Chandler|Chandler|  Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
Joey|Joey|  That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
Rachel|Rachel| I mean, this is unbelievable.
Phoebe|Phoebe| I know. This is really, really huge.
Chandler|Chandler| No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
Chandler|Chandler| OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
Monica|Monica| I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
Rachel|Rachel| No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?
Joey|Joey| Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
Rachel|Rachel| Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. 
Chandler|Chandler|  H-He's in China!
Joey|Joey| The country.
Monica|Monica| No, no, wait.  His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
Chandler|Chandler| What about the time difference?
Monica|Monica| From here to the airport?
Chandler|Chandler| Yes!  You're never gonna make it!
Monica|Monica| Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
Rachel|Rachel| I-I-I don't know.
Chandler|Chandler| Well then maybe you shouldn't go. 
Joey|Joey| He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
Monica|Monica| Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
Rachel|Rachel| I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Here, look, alright, does this help?
Rachel|Rachel| Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later. 
Chandler|Chandler| Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! 
Ross|Ross| 
Flight Attendant|Other| Alright!
Ross|Ross| Ni-chou chi-ma! 
Rachel|Rachel| Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
Flight Attendant|Other| Hi!
Rachel|Rachel| Hi.
Flight Attendant|Other| May I see your boarding pass?
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Flight Attendant|Other| Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
Rachel|Rachel| No, I know, but I—he just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
Flight Attendant|Other| No no no! Federal regulations!
Rachel|Rachel| OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
Flight Attendant|Other| Alright. What's the message?
Rachel|Rachel| Uh... I don't know.
Flight Attendant|Other| Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.
Man|Other|  What?
Flight Attendant|Other| It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.
Man|Other| : Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
Melanie|Other| Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!
Joey|Joey| Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Melanie|Other| Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! 
Joey|Joey|  Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
Melanie|Other|  M-Me again?
Joey|Joey| Sure! Why not?
Melanie|Other| Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow.
Melanie|Other| Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.
Joey|Joey| How do you mean?
Melanie|Other| I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman.
Monica|Monica| Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?
Rachel|Rachel| I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
Monica|Monica| Sure.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Sure.
Rachel|Rachel| I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Monica|Monica| Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
Monica|Monica| Another good point.
Phoebe|Phoebe| No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
Rachel|Rachel|  Huh?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Monica|Monica| Why isn't it working out?
Rachel|Rachel| I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Monica|Monica| Is he not cute enough for you?
Rachel|Rachel| No!
Monica|Monica| Does he not make enough money?
Rachel|Rachel| No, I'm just....
Phoebe|Phoebe| Maybe there's someone else.
Rachel|Rachel| Wha...
Monica|Monica| Is there? Is there someone else?
Rachel|Rachel| No! There is.. there is noone else!
Monica|Monica| Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
Chandler|Chandler| Hey, big...
Joey|Joey| Shhhh!
Chandler|Chandler|  ...spender.
Joey|Joey| She's still asleep.
Chandler|Chandler| So how'd it go?
Joey|Joey| Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
Chandler|Chandler| The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
Joey|Joey| Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Chandler|Chandler| Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.
Joey|Joey| It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
Chandler|Chandler| I didn't know you had another level.
Joey|Joey| I know! Neither did I!
Monica|Monica| Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?
Rachel|Rachel| Yeah.
Monica|Monica| Oh, from who?
Rachel|Rachel| From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Monica|Monica| Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?
Rachel|Rachel| Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this—this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Monica|Monica| Oh, why?
Rachel|Rachel| Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
Monica|Monica|  No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!
Rachel|Rachel| Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
Monica|Monica| I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.
Rachel|Rachel| Who is it?
Intercom|Other| It's me, Carl.
Rachel|Rachel| C'mon up.
Monica|Monica| Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
Joey|Joey| Seven hundred bucks!
Chandler|Chandler| Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Joey|Joey| Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.
Chandler|Chandler| Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
Joey|Joey| What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? 
Carl|Other| I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!
Ross|Ross| I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
Rachel|Rachel| Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.
Ross|Ross| Fine, just stop thinking about me.
Ross|Ross| Can't do it, can you?
Rachel|Rachel| So I'm thinking about you. So what?
Ross|Ross| I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
Rachel|Rachel| Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
Carl|Other| I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!
Ross|Ross| Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Rachel|Rachel| Ross, it's too hard.
Ross|Ross| No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade. 
Rachel|Rachel| Ross, you're like my best friend.
Ross|Ross| I know.
Rachel|Rachel| If we broke up, and I lost you...
Ross|Ross| Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?
Rachel|Rachel| Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
Ross|Ross|  No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
Rachel|Rachel| I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
Ross|Ross| Well, start looking. 
Rachel|Rachel| Wow.
Carl|Other| Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
Rachel|Rachel| Right! You're right!
Carl|Other| Heh... y'know?
Rachel|Rachel| You know what?
Carl|Other| What?
Rachel|Rachel| I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do....  I mean—I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry. 
Carl|Other| But...
Rachel|Rachel|  Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.
Man|Other| For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!
Ross|Ross| Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
Julie|Other| Oh, thanks, sweetie.
Ross|Ross| No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
Julie|Other| Really?
Ross|Ross| Yeah. 
Julie|Other| You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
Ross|Ross| No, no, they will. I just... uh...
Ross|Ross| Can't wait.
Julie|Other| Can't wait.
Ross|Ross| Come on, they're gonna love you.
