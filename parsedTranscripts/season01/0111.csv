Phoebe| Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Monica| Why?
Phoebe| Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
Monica| Oh my God.  Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression. 
Phoebe| Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.
Monica| He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Guy| Nice hat.
Monica|  Thanks.
Phoebe|  Thanks.
Phoebe| We should do something. Whistle.
Monica| We are not going to whistle.
Phoebe| Come on, do it.
Monica| No!
Phoebe| Do it!
Monica| No!
Phoebe| Do it do it do it!
Monica|  Woo-woo!
Phoebe| I can't believe you did that!
Monica| Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
Phoebe| I just wish there was something we could do.  Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
Monica| Phoebe, what are you doing?
Phoebe| Maybe nobody's tried this.
Monica| I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Phoebe| Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Monica| Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Phoebe| Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
Monica| I wish all guys could be like him.
Phoebe| I know.
Chandler| Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Monica| He doesn't have anyone.
Phoebe| Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
Joey| I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Rachel| Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! 
Jay Leno|  Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
Chandler| Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
Rachel| No way, forget it.
Joey| C'mon, she's your mom!
Chandler| Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
Rachel| Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
Chandler| Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
Ross| C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Chandler| You can say that because she's not your mom.
Ross| Oh, please...
Paolo| Bona sera.
Rachel| Oh, hi sweetie. 
Ross| When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Monica| Last night.
Ross| Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
Phoebe| Hey hey hey! She's on!
Paolo| Ah! Nora Bing!
Jay Leno|  ...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?
Phoebe| Your mom was arrested?
Chandler| Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
Mrs. Bing|  ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
Chandler| Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
All| Shhh.
Mrs. Bing|  ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
Chandler| THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Jay Leno|  Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
Mrs. Bing|  Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
All| Awww!
Chandler| This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Jay Leno|  Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
Mrs. Bing|  Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
Chandler| ...And then he burst into flames.
Monica| Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
Phoebe| What about Glen? He could be a Glen. 
Monica| Nah... not-not special enough.
Phoebe| Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
Monica| Waaay too special.
Mrs. Bing| I am famished. What do I want... 
Chandler| Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Mrs. Bing| Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
Chandler| Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Ross|  What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Mrs. Bing| Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug.  Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
Chandler| I know I am.
Mrs. Bing| Who's doing shots?
Monica| Yeah.
Phoebe| I'm in.
Mrs. Bing| There y'go. Ross?
Ross| Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Rachel| Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
Ross| ...But a man can change. 
Ross| Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Rachel| Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
Mrs. Bing| Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Chandler| Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Mrs. Bing| Yeah, any messages for room 226?
Mrs. Bing| You okay there, slugger?
Ross| Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. 
Mrs. Bing| What is with you tonight?
Ross| Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
Mrs. Bing|  Okay, thank you.  It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
Ross| No. It's the one he's licking.
Mrs. Bing| She's supposed to be with you.
Ross| You're good.
Mrs. Bing| Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
Ross| The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
Mrs. Bing| No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
Ross| When?
Mrs. Bing| He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
Ross| The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
Mrs. Bing| No, it's you!
Ross| Please.
Mrs. Bing| No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...
Ross| Right.
Mrs. Bing| You are gonna be fine, believe me.
Ross| Uh-oh...
Joey| Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
Ross| Hey, is Chandler here?
Joey| Yeah.
Ross| Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell...  Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
Joey| Right. No big deal.
Ross| Okay. 
Joey| In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
Ross| What code?
Joey| You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Chandler| What are you guys doing out here?
Ross| Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
Joey| Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
Ross| No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Joey| Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Chandler| Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. 
Ross| Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
Joey| Ross, how could you let this happen?
Ross| I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
Joey| You don't think my mom's sexy?
Ross| Well... not in the same way...
Joey| I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Ross| Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
Rachel| Hey.
Ross| Hey.
Rachel| What're you guys doing out here?
Ross| Well, not playing raquetball!
Joey| He forgot to leave his grip size!
Ross| He didn't get the goggles!
Rachel| Well,sounds like you two have issues.
Rachel| Goodbye, baby.
Paolo| Ciao, bela.
Ross| Do they wait for me to do this?
Joey| So are you gonna tell him?
Ross| Why would I tell him?
Joey| How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Ross| Oh...
Monica|  What are you guys doing here?
Joey| Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
Monica| ...What did I ask?
Monica| Hi.
Phoebe| Hi.
Monica| What are you doing here?
Phoebe| Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
Monica| I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
Phoebe| No.  No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
Monica| How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
Phoebe| Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! 
Chandler| Oh my God. 
Ross| You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
Chandler| I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
Ross| Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh...  I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
Chandler| What?
Ross| I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
Chandler|  You knew about this?
Joey| Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
Chandler| I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
Joey| Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
Ross| Thanks, man, big help.
Chandler|  I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
Ross| I wasn't- I mean, I-
Chandler| Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you. 
Ross| I know-
Chandler| I can't believe you did this. 
Ross| Chandler-
Joey| Me neither, y'know what-
Chandler| I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
Joey| What are you mad at me for?!
Ross| Chandler-
Chandler| You gotta let me slam the door! 
Joey|  Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did!  See what happens when you break the code?
Ross| Joey-
Joey| Ah!  Huh? 
Monica| Hey.
Rachel| Hey.
Monica|  'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'. 
Rachel| Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
Monica|  Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
Phoebe|  Hey Rach.
Rachel| Hey.
Phoebe| Hello.
Monica| Hello. 
Phoebe| Going to the hospital tonight?
Monica| No, you?
Phoebe| No, you?
Monica| You just asked me.
Phoebe| Okay, maybe it was a trick question.  Um, Rachel can we do this now?
Rachel| Okay.  I am so hot!
Joey|  Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
Ross| I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
Joey| C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
Rachel|  Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Phoebe| Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me.  'Kay.  
Rachel|  Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
Chandler| What was that?
Ross| Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
Chandler| Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? 
Joey|  Mother-Kisser...  I'll shut up.
Ross| Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
Chandler| Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare. 
Ross| Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
Chandler| Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
Ross|  We're rehearsing a Greek play.
Chandler| That's very funny. We done now?
Ross| No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
Chandler| That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
Ross| Okay, 'you' can't, or  you can't?  Okay, that's my finger.  That's, that's my knee.  Still doing the play. Aaah!
Phoebe| Alright, whadyou do with him?
Monica| Oh! You're awake!
Phoebe| Look at you! How, how do you feel?
Coma Guy| Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
Monica| You look good!
Coma Guy| I feel good! ...Who are you?
Monica| Oh, sorry.
Phoebe| I'm Phoebe Buffay.
Monica| I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Phoebe| Well, we both have.
Coma Guy| So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
Phoebe| Well, actually it's just from me.
Monica| I got you the foot massager.
Phoebe| You know who shaved you? That was me.
Monica| I read to you.
Phoebe| I sang.  Hah!
Coma Guy| Well,... thanks.
Monica| Oh, my pleasure.
Phoebe| You're welcome.
Coma Guy| So. I guess I'll see you around.
Phoebe| What, that's it? 
Monica|" ""See you around?"""
Coma Guy| Well, what do you want me to say?
Monica|" Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, ""That was nice?"" Admit something to me? ""I'll call you?"" "
Coma Guy| Alright, I'll call you.
Phoebe| I don't think you mean that.
Monica|" This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and ""See you around!"" Let's go, Phoebe."
Phoebe| Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
Mrs. Bing| Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?
Chandler| No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Mrs. Bing| Alright, well, be good, I love you. 
Chandler| You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
Mrs. Bing|  O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.
Chandler| Really stupid.
Mrs. Bing| Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?
Chandler| Yeah. No. No...
Ross| Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
Joey| Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
Ross| You're kidding.
Joey|" No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"""
Ross| Wow!
Joey|" Then she came back with ""The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"""
Ross|" 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say ""When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"""
Joey| That makes more sense.
Ross| So, what's going on now?
Joey| I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you!  I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. 
Ross| Whaddya see?
Joey| Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
Mrs. Bing| You okay, kiddo?
Chandler| Yeah, okay.
Mrs. Bing| Alright. 
Chandler| Nice save.
Ross|  Mrs. Bing.
Mrs. Bing| Mr. Geller.
Chandler| Hey.
Ross| You mean that?
Chandler| Yeah, why not.  So I told her.
Ross| Yeah? How'd it go?
Chandler| Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse. 
Ross| Well, howdya feel?
Chandler| Pretty good! I told her.
Ross| Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh?  But.. we don't have to go down that road.
Rachel| Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
Monica| What's a 'niffle'?
Joey| You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Rachel| Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
Ross| Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Rachel| Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
All| Nooo!
