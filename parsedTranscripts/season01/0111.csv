Phoebe|Phoebe| Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Monica|Monica| Why?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
Monica|Monica| Oh my God.  Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression. 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.
Monica|Monica| He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Guy|Other| Nice hat.
Monica|Monica|  Thanks.
Phoebe|Phoebe|  Thanks.
Phoebe|Phoebe| We should do something. Whistle.
Monica|Monica| We are not going to whistle.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Come on, do it.
Monica|Monica| No!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Do it!
Monica|Monica| No!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Do it do it do it!
Monica|Monica|  Woo-woo!
Phoebe|Phoebe| I can't believe you did that!
Monica|Monica| Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
Phoebe|Phoebe| I just wish there was something we could do.  Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
Monica|Monica| Phoebe, what are you doing?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Maybe nobody's tried this.
Monica|Monica| I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Monica|Monica| Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
Monica|Monica| I wish all guys could be like him.
Phoebe|Phoebe| I know.
Chandler|Chandler| Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
Monica|Monica| He doesn't have anyone.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
Joey|Joey| I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! 
Jay Leno|Other|  Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
Chandler|Chandler| Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
Rachel|Rachel| No way, forget it.
Joey|Joey| C'mon, she's your mom!
Chandler|Chandler| Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
Rachel|Rachel| Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
Ross|Ross| C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
Chandler|Chandler| You can say that because she's not your mom.
Ross|Ross| Oh, please...
Paolo|Other| Bona sera.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, hi sweetie. 
Ross|Ross| When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
Monica|Monica| Last night.
Ross|Ross| Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Hey hey hey! She's on!
Paolo|Other| Ah! Nora Bing!
Jay Leno|Other|  ...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Your mom was arrested?
Chandler|Chandler| Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
Mrs. Bing|Other|  ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
Chandler|Chandler| Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
All|Other| Shhh.
Mrs. Bing|Other|  ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
Chandler|Chandler| THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
Jay Leno|Other|  Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
Mrs. Bing|Other|  Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
All|Other| Awww!
Chandler|Chandler| This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
Jay Leno|Other|  Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
Mrs. Bing|Other|  Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
Chandler|Chandler| ...And then he burst into flames.
Monica|Monica| Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
Phoebe|Phoebe| What about Glen? He could be a Glen. 
Monica|Monica| Nah... not-not special enough.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
Monica|Monica| Waaay too special.
Mrs. Bing|Other| I am famished. What do I want... 
Chandler|Chandler| Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Mrs. Bing|Other| Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?
Chandler|Chandler| Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Ross|Ross|  What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Mrs. Bing|Other| Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug.  Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.
Chandler|Chandler| I know I am.
Mrs. Bing|Other| Who's doing shots?
Monica|Monica| Yeah.
Phoebe|Phoebe| I'm in.
Mrs. Bing|Other| There y'go. Ross?
Ross|Ross| Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Rachel|Rachel| Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
Ross|Ross| ...But a man can change. 
Ross|Ross| Anyone want me to appraise anything?
Rachel|Rachel| Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
Mrs. Bing|Other| Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Chandler|Chandler| Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
Mrs. Bing|Other| Yeah, any messages for room 226?
Mrs. Bing|Other| You okay there, slugger?
Ross|Ross| Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. 
Mrs. Bing|Other| What is with you tonight?
Ross|Ross| Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
Mrs. Bing|Other|  Okay, thank you.  It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.
Ross|Ross| No. It's the one he's licking.
Mrs. Bing|Other| She's supposed to be with you.
Ross|Ross| You're good.
Mrs. Bing|Other| Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?
Ross|Ross| The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
Mrs. Bing|Other| No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.
Ross|Ross| When?
Mrs. Bing|Other| He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
Ross|Ross| The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
Mrs. Bing|Other| No, it's you!
Ross|Ross| Please.
Mrs. Bing|Other| No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...
Ross|Ross| Right.
Mrs. Bing|Other| You are gonna be fine, believe me.
Ross|Ross| Uh-oh...
Joey|Joey| Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
Ross|Ross| Hey, is Chandler here?
Joey|Joey| Yeah.
Ross|Ross| Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell...  Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
Joey|Joey| Right. No big deal.
Ross|Ross| Okay. 
Joey|Joey| In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
Ross|Ross| What code?
Joey|Joey| You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Chandler|Chandler| What are you guys doing out here?
Ross|Ross| Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
Joey|Joey| Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
Ross|Ross| No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
Joey|Joey| Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Chandler|Chandler| Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
