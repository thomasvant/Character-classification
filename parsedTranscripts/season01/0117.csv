Rachel|Rachel|  Um... unless, unless I use yours.
Monica|Monica| Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
Rachel|Rachel|"  well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my ""In case of emergency"" person?"

Rachel|Rachel| Well, alright, then, forget it.  Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
Monica|Monica|  Okay, okay. I hate this.
Rachel|Rachel| Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
Monica|Monica|  Hi,  um, I'm gonna need a new set of  these forms .
Nurse|Other| Why?
Monica|Monica|  I am really an idiot.  you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information,  I put mine.
Nurse|Other| You are an idiot. .
Monica|Monica|  yep, that's me,  I am that stupid .
Ross|Ross| I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
Chandler|Chandler| That's nice.
Joey|Joey| That's nice.
Ross|Ross| No, no, with him.  I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
Joey|Joey| Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Ross|Ross| Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
Chandler|Chandler| What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Joey|Joey| He should take the sack?
Ross|Ross| Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
Chandler|Chandler| Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Joey|Joey| Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
Joey|Joey| Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
Chandler|Chandler| Well, only if you order stuff.
Joey|Joey| I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
Ross|Ross| Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
Joey|Joey| When's that?
Ross|Ross| Tonight.
Joey|Joey| Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
Ross|Ross| You take your time.
Chandler|Chandler| There it is! So what're you gonna do?
Joey|Joey| What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
Chandler|Chandler| And your friend Phoebe?
Joey|Joey| Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
Chandler|Chandler| Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
Dr. Mitchell|Other| ..you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
Dr. Mitchell|Other| Okay, errrr, Monica?
Monica|Monica| Yes?  ..yes, she is.
Rachel |Other| Hi, this is my friend Rachel.
Monica |Other| Hi.
Dr. Mitchell|Other|  Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr.Mitchell.
Dr. Rosen|Other|  And I'm his friend, Dr.Rosen.
Rachel|Rachel| Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
Dr. Rosen|Other| Excuse me?
Rachel|Rachel| I meant er,  young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
Monica |Other| Thank you.
Rachel |Other| Right.
Rachel|Rachel| ..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
Monica|Monica| Uh, you left out the stupid part.
Rachel|Rachel|" Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said ""yes."""
Monica|Monica| I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
Rachel|Rachel| What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors,  cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
Chandler|Chandler| Alright, what have we learned so far?
The Whole Party|Other|  SURPRISE!!!
Ross|Ross| What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
Rachel|Rachel| Was that the cake?
Ross|Ross| Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.

Ross|Ross| Oh, we just...
Phoebe's Friends|Other|  Surprise!
Phoebe|Phoebe|  oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi!  You found Betty! Oh my god!  This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room,  Where's Joey?
Chandler|Chandler| Did you see Betty?
Mr. Geller|Other|" I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say ""get out of my office!"""
Ross|Ross| Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
Mr. Geller|Other| I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;
Ross|Ross|" Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, ""Oh my god I'm gonna be a father"" kind of a thing?"
Mr. Geller|Other| No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
Ross|Ross| No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
Mr. Geller|Other| 'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
Ross|Ross| Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
Mr. Geller|Other| Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.
Mr. Geller|Other| So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
Ross|Ross| No, we can go to Williamsburg.
Mr. Geller|Other| Eat your fish.
Monica|Monica| Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
Rachel|Rachel|  Okay, coming!
Monica|Monica| Hi, come on in.
Dr. Mitchell|Other| Hey.
Monica|Monica| Hi, Geoffrey.
Rachel|Rachel| Hi.
Dr. Rosen|Other| Ah here, we brought wine.
Dr. Mitchell|Other| Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, that's great. Look at that.
Dr. Rosen|Other| So, Monica, how's the ankle?
Monica|Monica| It's uh...
Monica |Other| ..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
Rachel |Other| You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay...  STAT!
Rachel|Rachel| Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
Monica|Monica| It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
Monica|Monica| A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
Dr. Mitchell|Other| So?
Dr. Rosen|Other| So... they sss-still seem normal.
Dr. Mitchell|Other| That's because they are.
Dr. Rosen|Other|  okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
Dr. Mitchell|Other| Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine.  Go like this. 
Monica|Monica| I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
Rachel|Rachel|  I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
Monica|Monica| Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
Rachel|Rachel| You know what?
Monica|Monica| What?
Rachel|Rachel| You know what?
Monica|Monica| What!?
Rachel|Rachel| You know what?
Monica|Monica|  What!!?
Rachel|Rachel| Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
Rachel|Rachel| Hello! Here we go!
Dr. Rosen|Other| This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
Rachel|Rachel|  Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
Monica|Monica|  Yeah...  ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
Dr. Mitchell|Other| Really?
Monica|Monica|  Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me.  Why don't you try the hummus?
Dr. Rosen|Other| So, Monica, what do you do?
Rachel|Rachel|  Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
Dr. Rosen|Other| Good for you.
Rachel|Rachel|  Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
Dr. Rosen|Other| This hummus is great.
Dr. Mitchell|Other| God bless the chickpea.
Monica|Monica|   Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
Rachel|Rachel|  And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
Monica|Monica|  I used to wet my bed.
Rachel|Rachel|  I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
Monica|Monica| We both do that!
Dr. Mitchell|Other|  Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second...  ..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
Monica|Monica|  Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me.  li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
Rachel|Rachel| Would you excuse me for a second?
Monica|Monica|  Remember back in freshman year?  Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
Rachel|Rachel|  Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business!  ...dead!
Monica|Monica| Ross, he's got the remote again.
Ross|Ross| Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
Ross|Ross| Maybe not.
Rachel|Rachel| Hello?  Um, yeah, uh,  Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
Rachel|Rachel| It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
Rachel|Rachel| Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Monica|Monica| Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?

Rachel|Rachel| Okay  no, you do it.
Monica|Monica|  Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh...  Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down. Thank you. 
Rachel|Rachel| What?

Joey|Joey| Oh, Urse...
