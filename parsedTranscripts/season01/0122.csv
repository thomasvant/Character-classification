Monica|Monica| Tell him.
Rachel|Rachel| No.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Tell him, tell him.
Monica|Monica| Just...please tell him.
Rachel|Rachel| Shut up!
Chandler|Chandler| Tell me what?
Monica|Monica| Look at you, you won't even look at him.
Chandler|Chandler|  Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women won't look at me.
Rachel|Rachel| All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were...
Phoebe|Phoebe| Doing it on this table. 
Chandler|Chandler| Wow!
Joey|Joey| Exellent dream score.
Ross|Ross| Why, why, why would you dream that?
Chandler|Chandler| More importantly, was I any good?
Rachel|Rachel| Well, you were pretty damn good.
Chandler|Chandler| Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. 
Rachel|Rachel| Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table.
Ross|Ross| I love it, when we share.
Chandler|Chandler| You're okay there?
Ross|Ross| I can't belive you two had sex in her dream.
Chandler|Chandler| I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious.
Chandler|Chandler| Hello Rachel.
Rachel|Rachel| Get off.
Phoebe|Phoebe|  Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?
Joey|Joey| I don't know. What are you wearing?
Ross|Ross| Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.
Chandler|Chandler| Pirates again?
Phoebe|Phoebe|" No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this ""massage-yourself-at-home-workshop."" And they are."
Joey|Joey| Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you.
Chandler|Chandler|  Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.
Phoebe|Phoebe| What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
Chandler|Chandler| Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused.  It's a whole big boob story.
Phoebe|Phoebe| I could be a secretary.
Chandler|Chandler| Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.
Phoebe|Phoebe| I could do that.
Rachel|Rachel| What are you playing with?
Ross|Ross| Oh, it's my new beeper.
Joey|Joey| What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
Monica|Monica| Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, they're still extinct.'
Ross|Ross| No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO.
Chandler|Chandler| A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.
Monica|Monica| All right, I'll see you guys later. 
Rachel|Rachel| Off to see young Ethan?
Monica|Monica| Thank you.
Joey|Joey| How young is young Ethan? Young?
Monica|Monica| He's... our age.
Chandler|Chandler| When we were?
Monica|Monica| Okay, he's a senior in college.
Ross|Ross| College?
Chandler|Chandler| Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
Monica|Monica| No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
All|Other| What?
Monica|Monica| Oh, I can't pass for 22?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Well, maybe 25-26.
Monica|Monica| I am 26.
Phoebe|Phoebe| There you go.
Chandler|Chandler| Can you hear that?
Phoebe|Phoebe|  Yeah?
Chandler|Chandler| See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh. Uh, I'm on. 
Phoebe|Phoebe|  Mr. Bing's office.  No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
Chandler|Chandler| I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Will he know what this is in reference to?  And he has your number?  All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
Chandler|Chandler| What?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Ross says hi.
Chandler|Chandler| Ah!
Phoebe|Phoebe| This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
Chandler|Chandler| Well, now, I actually have to get to work.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Most likely.  Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
Chandler|Chandler| Okay.
Phoebe|Phoebe| All right. Bye bye.
Chandler|Chandler| Bye bye.
Chandler|Chandler|  Yes?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Whatcha doin'?
Chandler|Chandler| Ooh. 
Monica|Monica| Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish?  No, cause I made lasagne.  Am I out of control?
Rachel|Rachel| Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
Monica|Monica| What?
Rachel|Rachel| Could tonight be the Night?
Monica|Monica| I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.
Rachel|Rachel| So, did you shave your legs?
Monica|Monica| Yeah.
Rachel|Rachel| A-ha!
Joey|Joey| Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...
Ross|Ross| Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
Joey|Joey| All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.
Ross|Ross|  Yeah, hi, I was just beeped.  No, André is not here.  Third time today.  Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
Joey|Joey| Services?  Oh, services.
Ross|Ross|  Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir.  No, belive me, you don't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment.  All rightie, bye bye.
Joey|Joey| Hey, hey. How was the first day?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
Chandler|Chandler| See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes.  Me.
Phoebe|Phoebe| No, I didn't tell anybody that I knew you.
Chandler|Chandler| Why not?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, because, you know... they don't like you.
Chandler|Chandler| What?!
Phoebe|Phoebe| I thought you knew that.
Chandler|Chandler| Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
Chandler|Chandler| What are you talking about?
Phoebe|Phoebe|" Don't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like ""Mr. Boss Man"". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, ""Boss Man Bing""."
Chandler|Chandler| I can't belive it.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah, yeah. They even do you.
Chandler|Chandler| They do me?
Phoebe|Phoebe| You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
Chandler|Chandler| I don't sound like that.
Ross|Ross| Oh, oh Chandler...
Joey|Joey| Oh... Yeah, you do.
Ross|Ross| 'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
Joey|Joey|  My scones.
Phoebe|Phoebe| 'My scones.'
Joey|Joey| 'My scones.'
Ross|Ross| 'My scones.'
Chandler|Chandler| Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
Chandler|Chandler| That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
Monica|Monica| Did not.
Young Ethan|Other| I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
Monica|Monica| How was that possible?
Young Ethan|Other| Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there?  Oh, ah. I should go.
Monica|Monica| Okay.
Young Ethan|Other| Okay.
Monica|Monica| Unless...
Young Ethan|Other| What?
Monica|Monica| Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
Young Ethan|Other| Yeah, I'd really like that.
Young Ethan|Other| Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
Monica|Monica| Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Young Ethan|Other| Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
Monica|Monica| Ethan?
Young Ethan|Other| Yeah?
Monica|Monica| Are you a virgin?
Young Ethan|Other| Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
Monica|Monica| Really?
Young Ethan|Other| Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
Young Ethan|Other| Wow!
Monica|Monica| You keep saying that.
Young Ethan|Other| You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
Monica|Monica| Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Young Ethan|Other| Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
Monica|Monica| No-no. Nothing wrong about that. 
Young Ethan|Other| Oh.
Monica|Monica| Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months. 
Young Ethan|Other| Huh!
Monica|Monica| But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
Young Ethan|Other| Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
Monica|Monica| You're not a senior?
Young Ethan|Other| Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
Monica|Monica| Ok...ay.
Monica|Monica| What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.
Young Ethan|Other| I just had sex.
Monica|Monica| Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?
Young Ethan|Other| Well, you never told me how old you were.
Monica|Monica| Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?
Young Ethan|Other| I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Monica|Monica| Don't say it. 
Young Ethan|Other| ...in love with you.
Monica|Monica| Really?
Young Ethan|Other|  Sorry.
Monica|Monica| Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.
Young Ethan|Other| Who? 
Ross|Ross|  Okay, André should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye.  Just easier that way.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
Rachel|Rachel| No, forget it.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
Rachel|Rachel| All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there.  Joey was there too.
Joey|Joey| All right. 
Ross|Ross| Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.
Rachel|Rachel| No.
Ross|Ross| You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?
Rachel|Rachel| No, it was just the three of us.
Ross|Ross| Huh!
Joey|Joey| So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
Rachel|Rachel|  You know what?
Joey|Joey| What?
Rachel|Rachel| There were times when it wasn't even me.
Phoebe|Phoebe| That is so sweet, you guys. 
Ross|Ross| Hey, Mon.
Rachel|Rachel| Hey, Mon.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Hey, Mon.
Rachel|Rachel| Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?
All|Other|  Mon!
Monica|Monica| What?
Rachel|Rachel| Ethan called again.
Monica|Monica| Oh.
Ross|Ross| Are you not seeing him anymore?
Monica|Monica| No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Chandler|Chandler| And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Rachel|Rachel| I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
Joey|Joey| Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?
Ross|Ross| Oh, yeah.
Monica|Monica| Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
Joey|Joey| Sorry.
Chander|Other| Sorry.
Ross|Ross| Sorry.
Ross|Ross| It's morphin time!
Joey|Joey| Stegosaurus!
Chandler|Chandler| Tyrannosaurus!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Ooh, oh, I've gotta go.  Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go.  Cool!
Rachel|Rachel| Where are you going?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people.
Chandler|Chandler| Work people? Nobody told me.
Phoebe|Phoebe| No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravaganza.
Chandler|Chandler| You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.
Chandler|Chandler| You think I should?
Phoebe|Phoebe| I really do, yeah.
Chandler|Chandler| Okay.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Okay.
Chandler|Chandler| Okay.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I don't wanna be the geek that invited the boss.
Chandler|Chandler| I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.
Phoebe|Phoebe| You were great. But they still made fun of you.
Chandler|Chandler| What?
Phoebe|Phoebe|" You know, now you're more like, you know like, ""Mr. Caring Boss,"" ""Mr."", you know, ""I'm one of you, Boss,"" ""Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"""
Chandler|Chandler| Then, I don't get it.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
Chandler|Chandler| They do?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
Chandler|Chandler| I just wan't to...
Phoebe|Phoebe| No, but you can't.
Chandler|Chandler| But I just wa...
Phoebe|Phoebe| Uh uh.
Monica|Monica| Aren't you gonna...
Ross|Ross| Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
Joey|Joey| What about André?
Ross|Ross| Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.
Young Ethan|Other| Hey.
Monica|Monica| That was gonna be my opener.
Rachel|Rachel|  Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
Ross|Ross| I thought that was just a rumour.
Rachel|Rachel| True story.
Joey|Joey| They're here already?
Young Ethan|Other| All right, look. I've gotta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
Monica|Monica| It was.
Young Ethan|Other| Then, what's the problem?
Monica|Monica| Ethan, it's um... it's icky.
Young Ethan|Other| Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
Monica|Monica| This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...
Young Ethan|Other| No, don't say it. 
Monica|Monica| ...love you.
Ross|Ross| Are you're hands still wet?
Joey|Joey| Uh, moist, yeah.
Rachel|Rachel| Let's dry 'em again.
