Rachel| Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
Phoebe| Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go.  OK, thank you very much.
Chandler| Oh, great. This is just...
Rachel| Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
Monica| Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Rachel| Wow, you guys, this is big.
Monica|  Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. 
Phoebe| Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma.  What's my number? 
Phoebe| Well, I never call me.
Chandler| Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
Chandler| She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
Jill|  Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
Chandler| Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
Jill|  I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
Chandler| Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy. 
Joey| Hi everyone.
Ross| And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Joey| Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
Phoebe|  Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Rachel| That had to hurt!
Chandler| Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
Chandler| There you go!
Chandler| You're definitely scaring here.
Jill|  Would you like to call somebody? 
Chandler| Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks. 
Monica| Hello?
Chandler| Hey, it's me.
Monica|  It's Chandler!  Are you OK?
Chandler| Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
Monica| What?
Chandler| I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
Monica| I have no idea what you just said.
Chandler|  Put Joey on the phone.
Joey| What's up man?
Chandler| I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
Joey|  Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Chandler, listen. 
Chandler| Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
Rachel| Alright, somebody.
Monica| OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
All| Whoooaa!
Ross| That's my sister.
Joey| OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Monica| Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Ross| Pheebs, what about you?
Phoebe| Oh... Milwaukee.
Rachel| Um... Ross?
Ross| Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
All| No way!
Ross| The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Phoebe| Oh, Rachel.
Rachel| Oh come on, I already went.
Monica| You did not go!
All| Come on.
Rachel| Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed. 
Ross| Step back.
Joey| We have a winner!
Rachel| I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
Ross| Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
Rachel| There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course. 
Ross| Come on.
Rachel| No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
Ross|  And you didn't marry him because...?
Rachel| I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
Ross| Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated. 
Rachel| Yeah right.
Ross| It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
Rachel|  OK.
Ross| But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
Rachel| You don't.
Ross| Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Rachel| Really?
Ross| Mmmm.
Rachel| You do?
Ross| I do.
Rachel| Oh Ross, you're so great. 
Joey| It's never gonna happen.
Ross|  What?
Joey| You and Rachel.
Ross|  What?  Why not?
Joey| Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone. 
Ross| No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Joey| Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Ross| I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Joey| Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Ross| I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment.  What? What, now?
Joey| Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' 
Ross| Shhhh!
Rachel| What are you shushing?
Ross| We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.  Don't you hear that?
Rachel| Ahhhh!
Ross| See?
Rachel| Huh. 
Jill| Would you like some gum?
Chandler| Um, is it sugarless?
Jill|  Sorry, it's not.
Chandler| Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
Phoebe|  New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... 
Ross|  OK, here goes.
Joey| Are you going to do it?
Ross| I'm going to do it.
Joey| Do you want any help?
Ross| You come out there, you're a dead man.
Joey| Good luck, man.
Ross| Thanks.  OK.
Joey| OK. 
Joey| Hey, where are you going?
Monica| Outside.
Joey| You can't go out there.
Monica| Why not?
Joey| Because of... the reason.
Monica| And that would be?
Joey| I, um, can't tell you.
Monica| Joey, what's going on?
Joey| OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
Monica| About what?
Joey| He's planning your birthday party.
Monica| Oh my God! I love him!
Joey|  You'd better act surprised.
Phoebe| About what?
Monica| My surprise party!
Phoebe| What surprise party?
Monica| Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Phoebe| Well, he didn't tell me.
Joey| Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
Phoebe| This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
Monica| No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Phoebe| Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.  Looks like I was second to last.
Rachel| Hmmm... this is so nice.
Ross| OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
Rachel| OK.
Ross| OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Rachel| Ohhh!!!! 
Ross| Yes, yes, that's right...
Rachel| Oh, look at the little cat! 
Ross| What?  Ow!
Monica| I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Joey| I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Phoebe| I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
Monica|  This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
Joey| Sorry, that was wax.
Phoebe| Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
Ross| Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
Rachel| During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
Ross|  Yeah?
Chandler| You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.  'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
Phoebe|  Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
Rachel| Oh.  Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Mr. Heckles| Er, yeah, it's mine.
Phoebe|  He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
Mr. Heckles| Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
Phoebe| Wait a minute. What's his name?
Mr. Heckles| Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Rachel| Bob Buttons?
Mr. Heckles| Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
Phoebe|  Oooh! You are a very bad man!
Mr. Heckles|  You owe me a cat.
Rachel| Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
Paolo| 
Rachel| Wow. 
Ross|  Lucky sixes....
Rachel|  Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Monica|  Hi!
Rachel| And Joey....
Monica| Hi!
Rachel| And Ross.
Monica| Hi!
Paolo| 
Rachel|  He doesn't speak much English.
Paolo| Monopoly! 
Rachel| Look at that!
Ross|  So, um... where did Paolo come from?
Rachel| Oh... Italy, I think.
Ross| No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
Rachel| Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
Ross| That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.
Phoebe| Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
Rachel| Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
Phoebe| Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
Rachel| Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
Paolo| 
Phoebe|  You betcha!
Chandler| Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
Chandler| Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. 
Chandler| Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking. 
Jill| Are you alright?
Jill| My God, you're choking!  That better?
Chandler|  Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Jill| Perfection?
Paolo| 
Ross|  Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
Ross| Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
Rachel| I have absolutely no idea.
Ross| That's... that's classic.
Rachel|  Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
Monica| If you want, I'll do it.
Phoebe| I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip.  But I won't.
Rachel| God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
Phoebe| You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
Rachel| Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
Ross| Paolo. Hi.
Paolo| Ross!
Ross| Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
Paolo| Thing?
Ross| Thing, yes. Thing.
Paolo| Ah, you... have the sex?
Ross| No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um... 
Paolo| Bed?
Ross| No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
Paolo| Oh!
Ross| Yeah! Se vice?
Paolo| Si.
Ross| So you do know a little English.
Paolo| Poco... a leetle.
Ross| Do you know the word crapweasel?
Paolo| No.
Ross| That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
Jill| Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
Chandler| OK.
Jill| Ready? 
Jill| No, you've got to whip it. 
Phoebe| Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... 
Ross| Thank you.
Phoebe| Thanks.
Ross| Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Joey|  Bwah-hah-hah!
Ross| OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
Ross| Oh.. oh... oh.
Joey| Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Jill| Well, this has been fun.
Chandler| Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Jill| Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya.
Chandler| Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
