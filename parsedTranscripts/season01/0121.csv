Joey|Joey| How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
Monica|Monica| I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Rachel|Rachel| Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
Monica|Monica| I know. It's just such reckless spending.
Ross|Ross| I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
Chandler|Chandler| Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
Monica|Monica| That's me.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! 
Ross|Ross| Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-  come here, Marcel-
Rachel|Rachel| Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
Monica|Monica| Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
Ross|Ross| What? It's, it's just a phase.
Chandler|Chandler| Well, that's what we said about Joey...
Ross|Ross| Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
Rachel|Rachel|  Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
Ross|Ross| What?
Rachel|Rachel| Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
Monica|Monica| This woman's living my life.
Rachel|Rachel| What?
Monica|Monica| She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
Rachel|Rachel| You're not an artist.
Monica|Monica| Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
Monica|Monica| Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Rachel|Rachel|  Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
Monica|Monica| Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Rachel|Rachel|  Nooo...
Monica|Monica| This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
Chandler|Chandler| How about Joey... Pepponi?
Joey|Joey| No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Chandler|Chandler| Joey... Switzerland?
Joey|Joey| Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.  Which I'm not.
Chandler|Chandler| Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
Joey|Joey| Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Chandler|Chandler| Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
Joey|Joey|  Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Chandler|Chandler| Might wanna try Joseph.
Joey|Joey| Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Chandler|Chandler| Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
Rachel|Rachel| Hey.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Hey.
Monica|Monica| Hi.  Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Phoebe|Phoebe| What are you doing?
Monica|Monica|  Alright, great. Thanks a lot.  I'm going to tap class.
Rachel|Rachel| What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
Monica|Monica| This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Rachel|Rachel| Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
Phoebe|Phoebe| This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
Monica|Monica| What d'you think?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Lotsa things.
Rachel|Rachel| Which one do you think she is?
Teacher|Other| May I help you?
Monica|Monica| Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
Teacher|Other| You don't observe a dance class. You dance
Rachel|Rachel| What does she mean?
Phoebe|Phoebe| I think she means  'You dance
Monica|Monica| Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
Teacher|Other|  People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
Rachel|Rachel| She could be you.
Teacher|Other| Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
Monica|Monica| Okay, I'm not getting this!
Phoebe|Phoebe|  I'm totally getting it!
Monica|Monica| Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
Rachel|Rachel| What? You just click when they click.
Teacher|Other| Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
Monica|Monica| Great. It's gym class all over again.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Aww.
Rachel|Rachel| Aww.
Teacher|Other| Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
Monica|Monica| Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
Woman|Other| It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
Teacher|Other| She's your partner.
Woman|Other| Hi. I'm Monica.
Monica|Monica| Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
Woman|Other|  Monana?
Monica|Monica| Yeah. It's Dutch.
Fake Monica|Other| You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. 
Monica|Monica| Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
Teacher|Other| And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...
Ross|Ross|  Hi.
Chandler|Chandler| Hey.
Joey|Joey| Hey.
Joey|Joey| Where've you been?
Ross|Ross| At the vet.
Chandler|Chandler| She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
Ross|Ross| She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
Joey|Joey|  Hey! He beat ya.
Ross|Ross| She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
Chandler|Chandler| So what does this mean?
Ross|Ross| I'm gonna have to give him up.
Joey|Joey| I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
Chandler|Chandler| I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
Ross|Ross| I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Joey|Joey| Isn't there any way you can keep him?
Ross|Ross| No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
Joey|Joey| How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
Chandler|Chandler| I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Ross|Ross| Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
Chandler|Chandler| What?
Joey|Joey| Did you call the cops?
Rachel|Rachel| Nope. We took her to lunch.
Chandler|Chandler| Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Ross|Ross| What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Monica|Monica| Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
Ross|Ross| Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Chandler|Chandler| ...Take off their hats!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
Rachel|Rachel| No way. No way did you do this.
Fake Monica|Other| Monana was very brave.
Monica|Monica| It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
Fake Monica|Other| So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
Monica|Monica| ...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Rachel|Rachel| Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. 
Fake Monica|Other| Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
Monica|Monica| 'Scuse me?
Fake Monica|Other| There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Monica|Monica| Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
Fake Monica|Other| Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
Monica|Monica| What?
Fake Monica|Other| Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
Monica|Monica| Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
Fake Monica|Other| I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
Monica|Monica| Uh-huh.
Fake Monica|Other| I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Monica|Monica| Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
Ross|Ross|  Oh God.  We didn't get into Scranton.  That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
Phoebe|Phoebe| I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Ross|Ross| Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, somebody will.
Joey|Joey|  You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Chandler|Chandler| You're kidding.
Joey|Joey| Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
Chandler|Chandler| Y'know, you'd think I would've.
Joey|Joey| Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Phoebe|Phoebe| ...Flame Boy.
Ross|Ross| Where exactly is your zoo?
Dr. Baldhara|Other| Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
Ross|Ross| Yes.
Dr. Baldhara|Other| Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
Ross|Ross| No-no, he's, he's very docile.
Dr. Baldhara|Other| Even if he were... cornered?
Ross|Ross| Well I, I don't know. Why?
Dr. Baldhara|Other| Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
Ross|Ross| He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
Dr. Baldhara|Other| How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Ross|Ross| Why- why- why would he need a blade?
Dr. Baldhara|Other| Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
Chandler|Chandler| He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Joey|Joey| He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Joey|Joey| We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
Chandler|Chandler| ...He's in.
Ross|Ross| He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
Dr. Baldhara|Other| You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
Monica|Monica| Yo- hooo!
Rachel|Rachel| Where the hell've you been?
Monica|Monica| Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
Rachel|Rachel| Are you drunk?!
Monica|Monica| Noooo!  I'm lying. I am so drunk.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
Rachel|Rachel| Monica? Monica!
Monica|Monica| Water rules!
Rachel|Rachel| Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
Monica|Monica| Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
Rachel|Rachel| Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
Monica|Monica| No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
Rachel|Rachel| Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
Monica|Monica| Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
Rachel|Rachel| What?
Monica|Monica| They've arrested Monica.
Monica|Monica| Hi.
Fake Monica|Other| Hey.
Monica|Monica| How are you?
Fake Monica|Other| I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
Monica|Monica| Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
Fake Monica|Other| That I was not expecting.
Monica|Monica| I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
Fake Monica|Other| Oh. Thanks.
Monica|Monica| No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
Fake Monica|Other| Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
Monica|Monica| I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
Fake Monica|Other| Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Monica|Monica| Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
Fake Monica|Other| There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Monica|Monica| Not necessarily...
Fake Monica|Other| Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
Monica|Monica| Um, I'm not actually Amish.
Fake Monica|Other| Really? Then why are you like that?
Teacher|Other| You by the door. In or out?
Monica|Monica| In. 
Teacher|Other| You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
Monica|Monica| Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
PA|Other| This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
Ross|Ross| Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh!
Chandler|Chandler| Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
Joey|Joey| I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
Ross|Ross| Just, just say what you feel.
Joey|Joey| Marcel, I'm hungry.
Ross|Ross| That was good.
Rachel|Rachel|  Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
Ross|Ross| Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
All|Other| Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. 
Ross|Ross| Marcel, c'mere, c'mere.  Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be-  Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
Actor|Other|  Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...
Casting Director No. 1|Other| That's fine, thank you.
Casting Director No. 2|Other| Next. 
Joey|Joey| Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
Casting Director No. 2|Other| Name?
Joey|Joey| Holden McGroin.
