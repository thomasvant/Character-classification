Monica|2| Hey! So what do you think?
Chandler|4| New haircut?  Necklace?  Dress?  Boots?  Boots!
Monica|2| Yes! Now, they’re a little more than I normally spend on boots…or rent 
Chandler|4| Oh my God!
Monica|2| I know.
Chandler|4| I’m gonna miss being able to afford food.
Monica|2|" I’m sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, ""Oh, these are way too expensive for you."""
Chandler|4| She had a point.  
Rachel|1|  Hi!
Monica|2| Hey.
Rachel|1| Oh my God!  Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
Monica|2| They’re mine!
Chandler|4| Yeah well, too bad we’re gonna have to return them.
Rachel|1| Return them?! Shh! They’re gonna hear you!
Monica|2| Honey, I’m not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I’m going to wear them all the time. You’ll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?
Chandler|4| I have you.
Monica|2| Nice try; I’m keeping the boots.
Ross|6| That’s right, I love you! And-and I’m gonna play with you all the time.
Phoebe|5| How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
Rachel|1|  He’s talking to the baby.
Phoebe|5|" Ohh! Okay! Okay, cause when-when he said, ""I can’t wait to hear your first words,"" I thought, ""There’s a trick."""
Rachel|1| Okay. Well, I gotta go you guys. I’ll see you later.
Phoebe|5| Okay.
Ross|6| Bye.
Rachel|1| Bye. 
Joey|3| Oh hey Rach, listen—Hi!
Rachel|1| Hi.
Joey|3| Umm, can you do me a favor? I was talkin’ to my sister and she knows you work at Ralph Lauren…
Rachel|1| No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.
Joey|3| No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she’s really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y’know, to give her some advice.
Rachel|1| I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors…
Joey|3| Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!
Rachel|1| Really?! Oh my God! I’m successful!
Joey|3| Okay, so will you meet with her?
Rachel|1| Yes! I’d love to! Have her come by the office.
Joey|3| Great! Thanks! You’re gonna love her so much. And—Oh, she’s the smartest of all the Tribbiani children. Hey, y’know the S.A.T’s?
Rachel|1| Yeah.
Joey|3| She took ‘em!
Phoebe|5| Hey Ross! Doesn’t Ben go to the Smithfield Day School?
Ross|6| Yeah. Why?
Phoebe|5| Sting has a son that goes there too!
Ross|6| Yeah I know; he’s in Ben’s class.
Phoebe|5| You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
Ross|6| Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils? 
Phoebe|5| Sting’s son, seven years old and there’s a picture.
Ross|6| What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?
Phoebe|5| No, it’s New York magazine. It’s an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?
Ross|6| Uh, I actually haven’t even met him.
Phoebe|5| Uh-huh, yeah that’s too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it’s totally sold out. I know! Why don’t you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I’ll take you.
Ross|6| Well actually, I’m picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he’ll be there.
Phoebe|5| There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That’s why you have kids!
Monica|2| Hey guys!
Chandler|4| Hey-hey.
Rachel|1| Hi Monica!
Monica|2| Hey. 
Rachel|1| Hi boots.
Monica|2| See Chandler? I’m getting a lot of use out of them already! They’re very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants…
Chandler|4| You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them. 
Phoebe|5| Wow! They’re beautiful!
Rachel|1| Ahh…
Monica|2|  They hurt so much!
Phoebe|5| What?!
Monica|2| The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!
Rachel|1| Well-well you can give them to me! I haven’t felt my feet in years!
Monica|2| I can’t! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I’d wear them all the time, I just can’t give them away!
Phoebe|5| Well then get your money back and return them!
Monica|2| I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.
Ross|6|  Hey!
Chandler|4|  Hey!
Ross|6| Hey I uh just picked up Ben from school…
Chandler|4|  I don’t think you did a very thorough job!
Ross|6| I dropped him off at Carol’s.  Anyway, it turns out that I’m not going to be able to get those tickets though.
Phoebe|5| Oh no! Why not?
Ross|6| Well it turns out that Ben and Sting’s son do not get along.
Phoebe|5| How come?!
Ross|6| Apparently, Sting’s son made fun of the fact that Ben’s moms are lesbinims.
Phoebe|5| Wait! But Ross if they don’t get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
Ross|6| Phoebe, you can’t force kids to be friends.
Phoebe|5| Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
Ross|6| Playpen?! Ben’s seven!
Phoebe|5| Your kid is seven?!   He’s really small.  Please! Please get the tickets!
Ross|6| Look I’m sorry Pheebs, I can’t do it.
Phoebe|5| Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
Ross|6| What?
Phoebe|5| Rosssss can!
Ross|6| Look Phoebe, I’m sorry it’s just…
Phoebe|5| Rossss can!
Ross|6| Phoebe, I…
Phoebe|5| Rosss can! Give me the tickets! Ross can give me the tickets!!
Joey|3|  Here she is! Future fashion superstar!
Rachel|1| Oh Joey, I’m hardly a…
Joey|3| My little sister Dina!
Rachel|1| Right! Hi Dina! 
Dina|0| Hi.
Rachel|1| Nice to meet you. 
Dina|0| Thanks so much for meetin’ with me. Joey’s told me so much about you!
Joey|3| This is so exciting for her. Well, I’ll let you two fash…ists get down to business. 
Rachel|1| Okay. All right Dina, well let’s talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let’s see, there’s design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there’s-there’s sales, which is great because you get to travel…
Dina|0| I…I don’t care about fashion! I’m pregnant! And I know you are too, so you gotta help me!
Rachel|1|  And there’s marketing…
Monica|2|  Ahhhhhhhh!
Chandler|4|  What’s wrong?
Monica|2| Oh nothing I’m just—just was yawning. 
Chandler|4| Oh don’t forget, my office holiday party is tonight. 
Monica|2| Honey, we don’t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?
Chandler|4| Now sweetie, I know you don’t like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a…supple leather lining.
Monica|2| I-I don’t-I don’t think that I’m gonna wear the boots tonight.
Chandler|4| Why not?
Monica|2| Well y’know, I’m just-I’m just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!
Chandler|4| Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
Monica|2| Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don’t really go with it.
Chandler|4| You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
Monica|2| Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I’ll wear the boots. In fact, I’ll go into my room right now and y’know try the outfit on.
Chandler|4| Okay.
Monica|2| Okay?  Ooo wee! Christmas party in my boots! 
Dina|0| I-I can’t go in there. I can’t tell him!
Rachel|1| Honey, it’s going to be okay. He’s been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that’s what the meatball sub is for. 
Dina|0| Thank you.
Rachel|1| Okay.
Joey|3| Hey! It’s my fashion girls!  What’s wrong?
Rachel|1| Honey, why don’t you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
Joey|3|  Oh. What’s, what’s going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad’s heart? Is that a sandwich?
Dina|0| Joe, mom and dad are fine…
Joey|3| Is that a sandwich?!
Rachel|1| Joey…there’s something that you…should know. Dina?
Dina|0| I’m pregnant.
Joey|3|  What?!
Rachel|1|  Now! Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich! 
Joey|3| Well obviously this is a mistake! You can’t be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
Dina|0| Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!
Rachel|1| What?! Dina…
Joey|3|  Bub!!!   I can’t believe this! You’re the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!
Dina|0| Bobby Corso, but he’s a real nice guy. I like him a lot. He’s real funny.
Joey|3| You got pregnant for funny?! Dina…if he’s funny…laugh! All right, I’ll be back in a little while! You stay here!
Dina|0| Why? Where are you going?
Joey|3| I can’t look at you right now! 
Dina|0| Wow.
Rachel|1| I know.
Phoebe|5| Oh, there you are Ben!
Ben|0| Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
Phoebe|5| Well, I heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy’s name is Sting’s son.
Ben|0| Jack? I hate him! He’s a jerk.
Phoebe|5| Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.
Ben|0| I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there. 
Phoebe|5| Him you’re friends with. 
The Teacher|0| Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?
Phoebe|5| Yes! Yes you can, I’m looking for Jack’s parents.
The Teacher|0| Are you with one of the students?
Phoebe|5| Uh-huh, I’m with Ben.
The Teacher|0| Are you one of Ben’s mothers?
Phoebe|5| I am one of Ben’s mothers. I’m a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.
The Teacher|0| Well hi, I’m Jenny Boone. I’m the new teacher here.
Phoebe|5| Oh.
The Teacher|0| I’ve only met your partner Carol.
Phoebe|5| Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.
The Teacher|0| Right. Are you looking for Jack’s parents to discuss the problems he’s having with Ben?  Yeah. Because I really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.
Phoebe|5| Yeah! Let’s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?
The Teacher|0| Oh, their number is on the contact sheet.
Phoebe|5| Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Umm, could-could I get a copy of that? ‘Cause Carol threw it out, she lost ours. She’s such a scatterbrain, but man what a hot piece of ass.
Chandler|4| Y’know, that party wasn’t bad.
Monica|2| Yeah! I didn’t know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!
Chandler|4| I don’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?
Monica|2| Oh no, we can’t walk!
Chandler|4| What honey, it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let’s go.
Monica|2| Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
Chandler|4| What’s going on?
Monica|2| I can’t walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
Chandler|4| What?
Monica|2| Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They’re killing me! One toe at a time!
Chandler|4| So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right.  It’s oddly unsettling.
Monica|2| How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
Chandler|4| Hop on.
Monica|2| Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first.  Ah…Ooh…Oohh…Ohh…Oh God…Ohh…Oh…Ohh…Ohhhh…
Chandler|4| Honey, I know you’re in pain right now, but I’m a little turned on.
Dina|0| Do you ever worry that you’ll be walking and your baby will just like slip out?
Rachel|1| What college was that Dina?
Dina|0| Oh my God! Bobby!
Bobby|0| Hi Dina. Good to see you.
Rachel|1| Joey, what are you doing?
Joey|3| Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman…
Rachel|1| Oh Joey this is crazy!
Joey|3| Don’t interrupt me when I’m talkin’ to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man…
Dina|0| No!
Joey|3| Oh you’ll take ‘em!
Dina|0| No I won’t!
Joey|3| Hey! You don’t get a say in this!
Dina|0| Yes I do!
Joey|3|" Ahhh! I heard ""I do"", we’re halfway there! Okay!  You!"
Rachel|1| All right Joey! That is enough!  Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it’s not legal. Okay? They-they don’t have a marriage license, they don’t have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!
Bobby|0| Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
Joey|3| Well what am I supposed to do?
Rachel|1| You’re supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.
Joey|3| No they can’t! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
Rachel|1| Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective!  Right?
Bobby|0| Yeah…we kinda didn’t use any…
Rachel|1| Oh, come on kids! A little help here!
Phoebe|5| Wow! This place is incredible!  Sting’s pen…that he gave to Phoebe.  Come on! Secret passageway! 
Trudie Styler|0| Hi! 
Phoebe|5| Hi!
Trudie Styler|0| I’m Trudie.
Phoebe|5| Uh-huh.
Trudie Styler|0| You must be Ben’s mum.
Phoebe|5| Why else would I be here?
Trudie Styler|0| Do sit down.
Phoebe|5| Uh-huh. 
Trudie Styler|0| I gather Jack and Ben haven’t been getting along lately.
Phoebe|5| Yeah.
Trudie Styler|0| I’m told there are two sides to this story, but all I’ve heard is that Ben’s a bit of a poo-poo head.
Phoebe|5| Umm, I’m sorry. Won’t-won’t Jack’s father be joining us?
Trudie Styler|0| Oh I’m sorry, Jack’s father is not available.
Phoebe|5| Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o’clock?
Trudie Styler|0| Oh no, I know that wouldn’t work. My husband’s in concert.
Phoebe|5| Concert. Yeah. That does put us in…quite a pickle. Because you see I’m very busy before and after the concert, and he’s obviously busy during.
Trudie Styler|0| So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.
Phoebe|5| Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.
Trudie Styler|0| Are you here for tickets?
Phoebe|5| Oh, thank you. Four would be great.
Trudie Styler|0| I’m not giving concert tickets to someone who’d use their son like this!
Phoebe|5| Oh good! Then you’re in luck! Ben’s not my son!
Trudie Styler|0|  Look, I’ve just pressed a button, triggering a silent alarm. Any minute now, the police will be here!
Phoebe|5| The Police? Here? A reunion?! 
Chandler|4| Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.
Monica|2|  Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Chandler|4| Oh I’m sorry! Do you need a break?
Monica|2| My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
Chandler|4| I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.
Monica|2| Okay, I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
Chandler|4|  I don’t have your boots.
Monica|2| Well I don’t have them either. Where are they?
Chandler|4| Well, why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!
Monica|2| Okay.  God well, we gotta go back and get them!
Chandler|4| Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?
Monica|2| Okay, I’m never gonna wear them again. I just didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.
Chandler|4| Y’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
Monica|2| Okay.  All right.
Chandler|4| Okay. 
Monica|2|  Bye boots—Wait! Half off?! 
Rachel|1| Joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!
Joey|3| Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let’s hear their plan! Now, what’s the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
Bobby|0| Well…I really have high hopes for my band.
Joey|3|  You were right. He is funny.
Rachel|1| Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don’t you tell us a little bit about your band?
Bobby|0| Well it’s just me and my pal Rooster, the band’s name is Numb Nuts.
Rachel|1|  Really? 
Joey|3| Dina, if you’re having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby!  Dude, that’s not a compliment!
Dina|0| No Joey! I knew you wouldn’t be supportive!
Joey|3| So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You’re gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself…without a husband?! You can’t be a single mother alone! You’re gonna ruin your life!
Rachel|1| Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?
Joey|3| No! No! No! It’s different for you. You’re so strong and together. You’re not some dumb kid who doesn’t know what she’s doing.
Dina|0| Excuse me?
Joey|3| One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
Rachel|1| So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
Joey|3| Maybe!  Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!
Dina|0| Joey, I am scared to death about this. But I really think I can do it, I’m just gonna need some help. And Bobby’s gonna be here the whole time.
Bobby|0| You bet I am!  And to answer your earlier question, we’re straight-up gangster rap. 
Dina|0| Look, Rachel’s told me how much easier you’ve made all this on her. Why can’t you do that for me?
Joey|3| Because! ‘Cause… ‘Cause you’re my baby sister!
Dina|0| And you’re my big brother! I mean, you’re my favorite guy in the whole world. I’m not even scared to tell mom and dad. I was scared of telling you.
Joey|3| Well I’d be scared of them, but all right.
Dina|0| Joey, I can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. I want him to have his uncle. Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
Joey|3| Of course he’s gonna have his Uncle Joey!
Dina|0| We’re gonna be all right. I mean, even if we’re not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
Joey|3| That’s right! By his uncle too!
Bobby|0| And by you.
Rachel|1| Okay Bobby, why don’t we just come over here and let them have a little moment. 
Joey|3| Come here! 
Rachel|1| No! Seriously! What’s wrong with you?!
Ross|6| You’re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!! 
Phoebe|5| Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
Ross|6| Well…let’s just say…  Rosss caaaaan!
Phoebe|5| Oo, where are the seats?
Ross|6| Uh, middle balcony.
Phoebe|5| Okay, now would you say that that’s more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?
Ross|6| Yeah.
Phoebe|5| Then that’s not breaking the law! I’m there!
