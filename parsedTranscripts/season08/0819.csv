Rachel|1| Hi!
Ross|6| Hey!
Monica|2| Hey!
Rachel|1| So, I’m in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down. 
Joey|3|  Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That’s me!! I’m blank!!
Monica|2| How cool is this?! We know three down! I’m touching three down! 
Joey|3| Yeah you are baby.
Monica|2| Three down knows I’m married, what’s three down doin’?
Rachel|1| So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?
Joey|3| No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
Ross|6| Why’d you say no?
Joey|3| Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
Chandler|4| If only there was something in your head to control the things you say. 
Rachel|1| Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don’t know, gal pal Rachel Green?
Chandler|4| Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
Rachel|1| Okay, don’t listen to him. Please?
Joey|3| Fine! All right, I’ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y’know, start to say something stupid.
Ross|6| Just then or-or all the time, ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know.
Rachel|1| Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green.  Ha-ha! I’m gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle.  Seriously, proud of you.
Joey|3| Yeah.
The Interviewer|0| I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.
Joey|3| Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.
Monica|2|  You think we’re being obvious?
Chandler|4| No, we’re just four people with neck problems. You talk like this. 
The Interviewer|0|  Y’know I think its great you wanted to meet here. Y’know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant.
Joey|3|  Actually, I didn’t know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn’t have mattered, I’m doing this for the fans, not for the free food.
Gunther|0| Can I get you anything?
The Interviewer|0| Umm, I’ll have a cup of coffee.
Joey|3| And I’ll have all the muffins.
Phoebe|5|  Hey!
Ross|6| Shhh! We’re not talking.
Phoebe|5| Oh. Finally! Oh. 
The Interviewer|0| So, according to your bio, you’ve done quite a bit of work before Days of Our Lives. Anything you’re particularly proud of?

Ross|6| Uh, double latte, extra foam.
Chandler|4| And a bagel with only…
Phoebe|5|  I was just being polite!

Joey|3| Right.
The Interviewer|0| Like the candy?
Joey|3| Matter of fact, I do.
The Interviewer|0| Well umm, another thing our readers always want to know is how our soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have some kind of fitness regime?

Joey|3| I’ll take those to go.  For the kids.
The Interviewer|0| Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
Joey|3| It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’t have said. But believe me, that’s not gonna happen today.
The Interviewer|0| Understood. So, what’d you say back then?
Joey|3| Well, I said that I… 
Joey|3| You guys, this is Shelley, she’s interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends…
Rachel|1|  Hi! I’m gal pal Rachel Green, and if you want the dirt, I’m the one you come too. This might be Joey’s baby , who knows? I’m just kidding—Seriously,  gal pal Rachel Green.
Ross|6|  Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
The Interviewer|0| Umm, I’m gonna just go get this warmed up. 
Joey|3| Okay.
Monica|2| Joey! You’re doing great!
Ross|6| Yeah, so far nothing stupid.
Chandler|4| Mento?
Joey|3| No thanks.
The Interviewer|0|  So, as Joey’s friends, is there anything that you guys think our readers ought to know?
Ross|6| Uh no, no just-just that he is a great guy.
Rachel|1|  Yeah, that’s gonna get you into Soap Opera Digest. Well I……I would just like to say that Joey truly has enriched the days of our lives.
Phoebe|5| Umm, I…I just think you don’t expect someone so hot to be so sweet.
The Interviewer|0| Oh! I like that. What’s your name?
Phoebe|5| Umm, Phoebe Buffay.
The Interviewer|0| How do you spell that? So we can get it right.
Phoebe|5| Oh okay, it’s P as in Phoebe, H as in hoebe, O as in oebe, E as in ebe, B as in bee-bee and E as in  ‘Ello there mate!
The Interviewer|0| Great! Well, it was nice meeting all of you.
Ross|6| Yeah, you too.
Rachel|1| You too!
Chandler|4| Thanks.
Monica|2| Bye. 
The Interviewer|0| So it seems like you have a lot of friends, who would you say is your best friend?
Joey|3| How come you have two?  Chandler: Well this one's for you.  Joey: Get out.  Chandler: No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry,  it's about you and me and the fact that we're  best buds.  Joey: Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.  Chandler: That's what they'll call us.  
Rachel|1| Oh, Joey! Sorry!
Joey|3| No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.
Rachel|1| Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain! 
Joey|3| Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!
Rachel|1| Really?
Joey|3| Yeah! Look! 
Rachel|1| I’ve never lived like this before.
Joey|3| I know.
Joey|3| All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food. 
Ross|6| All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .
Joey|3| Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.

The Interviewer|0| So umm, now back to the show. How does it feel to have a huge gay fan base?
Joey|3| Really? Me? Wow! I don’t even know any huge gay people!
Chandler|4| It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
The Interviewer|0| Now, off the record, you’re not…
Joey|3| What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
Ross|6| Your make-up!
Ross|6| Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.
Joey|3| I think face to face.
Ross|6| I would say that.
Joey|3| Face to face, yeah!
Ross|6| Okay, here I go.
Joey|3| All right. 
Joey|3|  Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!
Ross|6| I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.
Joey|3| Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we thought it all the way through.

Joey|3| Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are. 
The Interviewer|0| So, let’s talk about women. I’m sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.
Joey|3|" Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, ""Hey, how you doin’?"""
Phoebe|5| Oh, please!
Joey|3|  Hey, how you doin’?
Joey|3| Hey! How you doin’?
Woman|0|  He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
Joey|3| I’d love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. She’s sleeping.  Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? 
Woman|0| Hi, is Rachel here? I’m her sister.
Rachel|1| Oh my God, Jill!
Jill|0| Oh my God, Rachel!
Chandler|4| Oh my God, introduce us!
Rachel|1| This is Chandler. 
Jill|0| Hi!
Rachel|1| And you know Monica and Ross!
Ross|6| Hi Jill.
Rachel|1| And that’s Phoebe , and that’s Joey.
Joey|3| Hey,  how you doin’?
Rachel|1| Don’t!! 
Janine|0| No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
Joey|3| Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
Janine|0| I don't think so.
Joey|3| Oh, I do.  How you doin?
Janine|0| I'm okay.
Joey|3| What?!?! Oh dear God!
Joey|3| Not much to tell there I’m really shy.
The Interviewer|0| So, that’s it. I guess that’s all I need. Thank you so much. I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.
Joey|3| Oh great! Great! Thank you. 
The Interviewer|0| Bye.
Joey|3| Bye-bye.  I did it!
Rachel|1| Yeah!
Ross|6| Amazing! Amazing!
The Interviewer|0|  Oh wait! I almost forgot. We have to ask everybody this. Other than Days of Our Lives, what’s your favorite soap opera?
Joey|3| Oh, I don’t watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y’know?
The Interviewer|0| Thank you. The readers at Soap Opera Digest will be happy to hear that.
Joey|3| Oh, good to know.  So close!
Rachel|1| Wow! I can’t believe they didn’t put it in the part where you said you didn’t watch soap operas.
Joey|3| Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.
Monica|2| You slept with her didn’t you?
Joey|3| Little bit, yeah.
Ross|6| Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.
Joey|3| Oh yeah, that’s just a little something for my huge gay fan base. 
Ross|6| Did you just wink at me?
Joey|3| Hey, you’re the one that loves the picture.
