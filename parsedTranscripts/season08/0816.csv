Ross|  Did you um—I’m sorry, did you just say it’s Rachel?
Joey| Yes.
Ross| Um, you…you like Rachel?
Joey| Yes. I like Rachel.
Ross| Rachel?!
Joey|  Yeah, okay but look, buy uh—Hey-hey, y’know, y’know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn’t get said enough. I like you Ross.
Ross| But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?! 
Joey| Yeah, but it’s not a big deal.
Ross| It’s not a big deal? Oh, I’m sorry I just…um, I…what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like—you-you can’t stop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?
Joey| I’m an actor, y’know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
Ross| Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?
Joey| Look no, I-I know it’s bad, and I know it’s wrong. Okay? But-but it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. Y’know? These-these are just feelings, they’re gonna go away.
Ross| Y’know what? I-I gotta go. 
Joey| Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don’t…
Ross|  I just—y’know—I-I just have one—Rachel?! 
Gunther| Rachel?!!
Rachel| Oh-oh! Okay, she’s kicking!
Chandler| Oh!  She’s growing inside you.
Rachel| Whoa!!
Chandler| Oh! 
Rachel| Wow that was a big one.
Chandler| I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Phoebe|  Oh hey you guys!
Chandler| Oh hey!
Rachel| Hi!
Phoebe| Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
Rachel| Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.
Phoebe| Uh-huh,  and you?
Chandler| No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don’t think they exist.
Phoebe| Okay, good.
Chandler| Why?
Phoebe| Well last night, I met Monica’s.
Chandler| What?
Phoebe| Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.
Chandler| Come on, don’t be crazy.  You don’t think there’s someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? 
Rachel|  Well, what’s he like?!
Phoebe| Well he’s tall.
Rachel| Uh-huh.
Phoebe| He has brown hair.
Rachel| Of course, of course.
Chandler| A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
Phoebe| He works with food!
Rachel| Oh sure. Older?
Phoebe| Obviously, and he’s British.
Rachel| Oh, I was just gonna ask!
Phoebe| Yeah? And, he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident.
Rachel| Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.
Chandler| Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.
Phoebe| Oh, I’m so sorry. Um, and maybe I’m wrong! I but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again, I’ll find out more.
Chandler| You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?
Phoebe| Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat.
Monica| Hey.
Ross| Hey.
Monica| I just talked to Joey, I just—I want to see how you were.
Ross| Oh y’know, I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out, only weirder!
Monica| All right, I know you’re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don’t say that again.
Ross| Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he’d be the stepfather of my child.
Monica| Honey, I don’t think that’s something we need to worry about! First of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she’d react.
Ross| Sure, because women never like Joey. Y’know, I think he’s a virgin.
Monica| Joey…he’s not even thinking about going after Rachel!
Ross| He’s not?
Monica| No! All he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! I mean, listen it’s totally freaking him out. He’s talking about moving to Vermont.
Ross| Why?
Monica| He says he wants to leave the country.  He thinks you hate him.
Ross| Hate him? I… No, I don’t hate him.  It’s just it’s Rachel, y’know?
Monica| Honey I can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don’t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you’re still his friend.
Ross| Okay. Okay, I’ll talk to him.
Monica| All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
Phoebe| Oh! Hi!
Monica| Hi!
Phoebe| Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
Don| Oh, hello.  Hello. 
Phoebe|  Soul mate.
Chandler|  What?
Phoebe|  Soul mate.
Monica| So, what have you guys been doing?
Don| Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?
Monica| I know! What is this, 1985?!
Don| That’s exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn’t that strange.
Monica| Not really.
Chandler| What’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?  On a barbecue chicken pizza?  No?
Monica| So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
Don| Well, Octavio, 27&7—Oh! And there’s this great little place, Alessandro’s.
Monica| Oh my God! That’s my restaurant, I’m the chef there.
Don| You’re kidding me!
Monica| No!
Don| Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu, once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?
Monica| Oh, I’d like a latte. Oh y’know what? If you’re gonna talk about me, I’m gonna go with you. 
Chandler| What are you doing?!
Phoebe| Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…
Chandler| I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
Phoebe| They’re just talking, and y’know what? Just because I think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.
Monica|  Phoebe, good work.
Phoebe| Yeah?
Monica| Yeah! Oh he’s great, I love him. 
Phoebe| Don’t worry, we’ll find you someone else.
Joey| Hey.
Ross| Hey.
Joey| Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.
Ross| No, I don’t want to hit you.
Joey| Oh what then? Kick me?
Ross| No.
Joey|  Bite me?
Ross| No, no I don’t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I’m not mad at you and…and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that. 
Joey| Oh now—Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?
Ross| Uh…yeah sure. 
Joey| Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don’t…
Ross| Okay.
Joey|  Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh…I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. 
Ross| Thank you.
Joey| Anyway, it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get over her, that’s all. I’m not even sure how to do that, I mean I’ve never been in love before so…
Ross| What?! You’re in love with her.
Joey| Yeah, I thought you knew that.
Ross| Umm, no.
Joey|" Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don’t want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, ""Ah, I’ll get over this."" Y’know? I just—It just keeps gettin’ harder. I don’t, I don’t know what to do. Y’know? What do I do?"
Ross| I think you need to tell her how you feel.
Joey| Okay that’s the green stuff talkin’.
Ross| No, I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she’s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
Joey| But what if uh—and I’m not saying she will be—But…
Ross| If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it shouldn’t stand in the way.
Joey| Are you sure?
Ross| Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn’t find a better guy. So…
Joey| Hey thanks.
Ross| So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?
Joey| Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven’t even thought about what I will say. What should I say?
Ross| I’m understanding, but let’s not get carried away.
Joey| I’m sorry, you’re right. What am I gonna say?  Oh!
Ross| Yeah, tell me about it. 
Don| …so I’ve been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
Chandler| Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
Don| Excuse me?
Chandler| Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
Don| Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I’m one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.
Monica| Me too! Yeah, Chandler can’t stand it. He won’t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
Don| And you’re still married to him? 
Monica| You know what I’d love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese—Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries…  And pate. Oh, I’m really not high, it’s just I used to be fat.
Don| Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I’ve got a great little villa you can stay at.
Chandler| Is it made of cheese?
Don| No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn’t that be incredible?!
Monica| I’d move in tomorrow!
Chandler|  Oh come on!  Are you listening to this?
Phoebe| I’m so sorry.
Chandler| What do we do?
Phoebe| I don’t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don’t know how you fight that.
Joey| Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight.  Take a couple deep breaths.  Look confident. 
Rachel| Joey? What’s up?
Joey| I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.
Rachel| Okay what’s up?
Joey| Here? In the hall? What are we animals?
Rachel| Well honey, I’m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
Joey| Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I…want to have dinner with you tonight. That’s all.
Rachel| Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay? 
Joey| Okay. That’s good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what you’re gonna say. Good. Yeah.  Don’t you people ever knock?!
Monica| I’d like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn’t that be nice?
Chandler| Sure, why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here, browsing through the personals.
Monica| Are you okay? You’ve been acting weird all afternoon.
Chandler| Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
Monica| Jeez! What is with you?
Chandler| I’m sorry, did you say cheese?
Monica| All right, what’s going on?
Chandler| Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don’t believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won’t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
Monica| Chandler, you don’t believe in soul mates?
Chandler| No. But I’m sure  ‘tomatoes’ does.
Monica| I don’t believe in soul mates either.
Chandler| You don’t?
Monica| No. I don’t think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.
Chandler| So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?
Monica| No, I’ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?
Chandler| I love you.
Monica| I know.
Chandler| Y’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .  No? Really? They taste so good.
Rachel| …and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I’m really worried the baby’s not going to like him.  Are you okay?
Joey| What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason…—Is it hot in here?
Rachel| No. Not-not for me, but why don’t you take off your sweater?
Joey| I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.
Rachel| Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?
Joey| Yeah. Sure. 
Rachel| Huh. Wow, I wouldn’t think Hobbs would like that so much.
Joey| Uh… How long have we known each other?
Rachel| Um, seven…e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.
Joey| Uh-huh, long time.
Rachel| Yeah.
Joey| But over the past few weeks…
Waiter| Hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! We have a couple specials tonight…
Joey| Actually uh, could you give us a second?
Waiter| Sure. Sure.  Second’s up!  Not…that kind of table. 
Rachel| So you were saying?
Joey| I’m not quite sure.
Rachel|" Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, ""Eight years."" And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm…now here we are."
Joey| Yeah, here we are. Uhh… I… I think I’m…falling in love with you.
Rachel|  What?
Joey| I’m falling in love with you.
Rachel|  Who are you talking too? Oh, you’re kidding! Oh, it’s a joke!  It’s funny. It’s funny. I don’t get it.  Oh.  Okay. Umm… I-I…uh, wow. Are you uh… How did umm… When?
Joey| Does it really matter?
Rachel| Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.
Joey| Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don’t have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need.  Okay, you gotta say something!
Rachel| Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I…
Joey| But. 
Rachel| Joey.
Joey| Yeah-yeah right. That’s okay. That’s fine. That’s uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it’s no big deal. All right? I think I’m gonna go. 
Rachel| No! Joey please! Please don’t! Please don’t leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! 
Joey| Don’t start doing that. You can’t do that Rach, ‘cause then you’re gonna make me do that.  Oh, here we go! 
Rachel| Can I? 
Joey| Sure! 
Rachel| Oh Joey honey I don’t…I don’t want to lose…
Joey| Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can’t. Okay? Ever!
Rachel| I’m so sorry.
Joey| Oh no-no Rach, please, don’t be sorry. Okay? Don’t be sorry.  Y’know I was only kidding you.
Rachel| Yeah, that was a real good one.
Waiter No. 2| Is this your table?
Waiter| Yeah.
Waiter No. 2| God, you’re gonna be here all night!
Waiter| I know! I haven’t even read them the specials yet!
Waiter No. 2| What’s the matter with them?
Waiter| I don’t know. I think maybe one of them is dying.  I kinda hope it’s the girl.  The guy is really cute!
