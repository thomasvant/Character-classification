Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| She was

Chandler|4| But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah, for sure
Joey|3| Okay
Joey|3| Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes
Joey|3| Y'know, because you don’t want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don’t want to be seeing
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yeah
Chandler|4| Good call, nice one
