Rachel| So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Monica| Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Phoebe| Oh my God, they took my idea!
Monica| That was you?!
Phoebe| Yeah! Okay, here you go. 
Gunther|  Rachel, I made you a cocoa. 
Phoebe| Oh my God, are you guys okay?
Gunther| Are you all right?
Joey|  Oh my.
Chandler|  Hey.
Joey| Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Chandler| Oh, so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me.  Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.
Joey| Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy’s theory. Okay?
Ross|  Hey!
Chandler| Hey.
Ross|  I’m gonna be on TV!!
Chandler| No way!
Ross| Yeah! They’re putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel’s gonna film it!
Chandler| Oh my God! Who’s gonna watch that?!
Ross| Thanks. You ready to go?
Chandler| Yeah. 
Joey| Saw a girl with that vest.
Chandler| Thanks. 
Anchorwoman|  While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents.  Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won’t live to see the fourth of July.  Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
Joey|  Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? ‘Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
Pete| Hi!
Monica| Hi! Hey, Pete you’re back! Hey, check this out. 
Pete| Wow! Skates! 
Monica| Wow! You’re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you’re trip?
Pete| Well... 
Monica| Oh, what’d ya bring me?!  Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
Pete| Yeah, sure, that’d be great.
Monica|  Regular or decaf?
Pete| Ah, which ever is closest. 
Monica| Okay. 
Pete| So ask me what I did today.
Monica| So what did you do today Pete?
Pete| I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
Monica| What?! Oh.
Monica| Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
Rachel| What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
Monica| I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica’s Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues.  But Pete’s just doing this because he has a crush on me.
Rachel| And you’re still not attracted to him at all?
Monica| Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
Rachel| Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health teacher.
Monica| Oh, please. 
Monica| What? Honey.
Rachel| Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Monica| Oh God, I’m so sorry.
Rachel| I know. 
Rachel| Ow!!
Monica| Oh God!
Ross|  Hey, you guys! Guess what?
Rachel|  Got a job on a river boat?
Ross| Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...
Rachel| Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Ross| Right.
Rachel| Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid as you like.
Ross|  You like it right?
Monica| Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!
Rachel| Yeah, come here!
Monica| What-what was it you were gonna tell us? 
Rachel| Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
Ross| Okay, good bye! 
Chandler| So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
Phoebe| Umm, oh, about three months.
Chandler| Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
Joey|  Hey!!
Chandler| Hey!
Joey| I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Chandler| Okay.  It’s a chicken.
Joey| It’s cute, huh?
Phoebe| Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Chandler| Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
Phoebe| Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot’s and lot’s of love.
Joey| Oh, well no problem there. 
Chandler| Easy Lenny.
Pete| So? I mean have you thought about it?
Monica| Okay. Here’s the thing.
Pete| Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What’s the thing?
Monica| I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
Pete| Wait, wait, wait, wait, that’s-that’s what you’re worried about? If that’s the problem, we’ve got no problem.
Monica| Huh?
Pete| No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.
Monica| Oh?
Pete| Her name’s Ann, she’s a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
Monica| Oh, that’s great! I mean I’m-I’m sorry, but I’m so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
Pete| I guess you can.
Monica| Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh!  All right, y'know what? I’m just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
Pete| All right.
Monica| Okay.  Can you give me a little push?
Pete| Yeah, sure. Good luck!
Monica|  I’m quitting!! Woo-hoo!  I’m okay!! I’m all right!!
Phoebe|  Wow! That’s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
Pete| What?
Phoebe| I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No?
Pete| Why would you say that?
Phoebe| ‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
Pete| You’re good. You’re good!
Phoebe| Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial gift.
Pete| Listen, can you promise me that you won’t tell her though?
Phoebe| Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Pete| Thanks a lot.
Phoebe| No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks.
Chandler| Okay, but this is the last time.  With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
Joey| Hey.
Chandler| Hey.
Joey| How’s she doing?
Chandler| She?
Joey| Well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?
Chandler| I don’t know.  I can’t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
Joey| Well, anyway, I got to go change, I’m ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Chandler| Excuse me?
Joey| What?
Chandler| I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
Joey| Hey! Who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
Chandler| You don’t think I get up when you get up?
Joey| Ohhh, here it comes.
Chandler| Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don’t think so mister!
Joey| Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
Chandler| And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?
Joey| That’s not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
Chandler| I know what you meant!!  You notice that ever since we got this chick, we’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?
Joey| I don’t know, maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick.
Chandler| I’ll take her back tomorrow.
Joey| Do you think we’ll get our three bucks back?
Ross|  Hey!
Chandler| Hey!
Ross|  Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think?  This blue suit, or this brown one?
Joey| Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
Ross| Really? 
Rachel|  Oww! 
Ross| Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Rachel|  Oww!
Ross| Oh my God, is that still...
Rachel| I’m fine, I’m fine.
Ross| No you’re not.
Rachel| Yes I am! 
Ross| Rach!
Rachel| Look, I’m fine. Watch.  Look at that.  Whoa-whoa!
Ross|  Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
Rachel| No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It’s a very big deal, there’s a lot of people there I have to meet.
Ross| And I’m sure you’re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I’m Rachel Green. It’s nice to meet you.  Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
Rachel| Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be broken then.
Ross| Rach...
Rachel| But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.
Ross| Rachel...
Rachel| Look, either help me or go.
Ross| Fine. I’ll go.
Rachel|  Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?
Ross|  Sure. I’ll help you.
Chandler|  Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
Rachel|  Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?
Ross| Ohh. 
Rachel|  Okay. Let’s use this brush. 
Ross| Okay. This stuff? 
Rachel| Yeah.
Ross| All right.
Rachel| Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.
Ross| Oke-dokey. 
Rachel| Oh-ho!
Ross| Sorry.
Rachel| Hey! That’s just poking me in the eye!
Ross| Sorry, I’m sorry. Close, close, close...
Rachel| Okay, just sweep it.
Ross| I’m sweeping...
Rachel| Right.
Ross| Sweep, sweep....
Rachel| Okay, now make it even, ‘cause we don’t...
Ross| What? What?
Rachel| We don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.
Ross| No. No, y'know you don’t, you don’t wear enough of this.  What?
Rachel| Since when, since when do you think I don’t wear enough of this?
Ross| Well I, close your eyes, I just think you’re gonna like this a little better, ‘cause, close-close... 
Rachel| Blow it.
Ross|  Sorry. ‘Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Rachel| Sophisticated like a hooker?
Monica| Hey!
Phoebe| Hey! 
Monica| Hey, guess what I’m doing tonight.
Phoebe| What?
Monica| I’m checking out the restaurant with Pete.
Phoebe| Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
Monica| I know.
Phoebe| Ooh, I have to tell you something.
Monica| What?
Phoebe| But I can’t tell you.
Monica| Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.
Phoebe| Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
Monica| Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Phoebe| No.
Monica| Does it have to do with Joey?
Phoebe| No.
Monica| Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?
Phoebe| No, but let’s come back to that later!
Ross| There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?
Rachel| Sure.
Ross| Yep?
Rachel| Sure, I’ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
Ross| Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?
Rachel| Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
Ross|  Sure, okay.
Rachel| Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
Ross| What?
Rachel| I don’t want you to see me naked!
Ross| Rachel, I’ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?
Rachel| Yeah, but that was different. Y’know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it’s weird.
Ross| Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.
Rachel| What?
Ross| All I have to do is close my eyes. See?  Woo-hoo!!
Rachel| Ross! Stop that!
Ross| Ah, I’m sorry.
Rachel| Come on! I don’t want you thinking of me like that any more!
Ross| Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It’s one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend.  Oop, oh yeah!
Rachel| Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Ross| Okay, okay, I’m sorry, it will never happen...  Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I’m the king. 
Rachel| Rosss...
Ross| Come on, would you grow up? It’s no big deal.
Rachel| All right.  Fine.
Ross| Yowzah!!!
Rachel| O-kay!! See what you did, I’m gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay? 
Ross| Aww, come on.
Rachel| That’s it.  Ow!!! 
Ross| Oh my God!
Rachel| Oh-ow!
Ross| All right.
Rachel| Ow!
Ross| Look...
Rachel| Ow!
Ross| Okay.
Rachel| Ow!
Ross| Rach?
Rachel| Ow! Ow!
Ross| Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
Rachel| Okay, I do. 
Ross| Okay.
Rachel| I really do.
Ross| Okay, I’m gonna get your coat and then I’ll-I’ll put you in a cab.
Rachel| Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you’re not gonna come with me?
Ross|  Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
Rachel| Okay.
Ross| Okay? 
Rachel| Thank you.  Oww!!!! God!
Ross|  What?! I wh-, what’s wrong?
Rachel| I’m sorry, I just can’t go to the hospital lookin’ like this.
Monica| Does it involve travel?
Phoebe| Noo!
Monica| Does it involve clogs?
Phoebe| Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?
Monica| Clogs.
Phoebe| No.
Monica| Claws?!
Phoebe| No.
Monica| Okay, so it doesn’t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?
Phoebe|  No!
Monica| What is it?! What about Pete?
Phoebe| I don’t know! 
Monica| Okay, I feel like I’m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!
Phoebe| I can’t!!
Monica| Okay, I gotta go. 
Phoebe| I, but you’re so close! No!
Monica| Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete’s computer company?
Phoebe| Oh, just go. You’re never gonna get it!
Chandler| I know. See, yes. That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.
Joey|  Hey!
Chandler| Hey!
Joey|  Ohhh.  Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
Chandler| I did! But the store wouldn’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out? 
Chandler| If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
Joey| Okay, good, good, good, ‘cause, good, ‘cause I was kinda having second thoughts too. 
Chandler| Okay. And it’s not just chicks y'know? It’s all kinds of other animals!
Joey| That’s horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
Chandler| Thanks, I’m glad you see it that way.
Chandler| Ohhh-hoo, funny story!
Monica| I don’t believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It’s gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I’d be cold, but I’m always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.
Pete| So you like it?
Monica| Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much. 
Pete| Oh, you’re welcome. 
Monica| Did you just smell my hair?
Pete| Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.
Monica| Oh God.
Pete| What?
Monica| You still have feelings for me don’t you?
Pete| Now, nooo! I’m just excited about the restaurant, that’s all.
Monica| Pete.
Pete| Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
Monica| No, it’s not bad. It’s not bad at all. It’s-it’s really nice.
Pete| Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I’m okay with that.
Monica| You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That’s why I can’t take this job.
Pete| What?
Monica| And well, we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore. I’m sorry.
Pete| Okay, yeah. I mean... If that’s, if that’s really what you want, okay.
Monica| Okay, bye. 
Pete| I’m sorry things didn’t work out...
Monica| All right shut up for a second and let me just see something.  Oh, wow! 
Rachel| Okay, you’d tell me the truth. Right?
Ross| Rach, you can’t look fat in an x-ray.
Rachel| Okay.
Chandler| Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
Ross|  That’s a duck.
Chandler| That’s a bad duck!!!  How’d the thing go tonight, Ross?
Ross| Oh, it was, nah, well....
Rachel| What thing? What thing?
Ross| Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on.  Easy.
Chandler|  Okay, now when you come back I hope you remember that, that chick is not a toy! 
Rachel| What thing? What is this thing?
Ross| I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
Rachel| Oh my God! 
Ross| Yeah.
Rachel| Ross, why didn’t you tell me that?
Ross| Eh, ‘cause I knew that if I told you, you’d make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
Rachel| I cannot believe you.
Ross| What?
Rachel| That is the sweetest thing, I just....
Ross|  You should get some sleep.
Rachel| Okay.
Ross| So, I’ll umm...
Rachel| Oh, I’m sorry I spoiled you’re evening.
Ross| No, that’s, no, as long as you’re okay. So I’ll ah, I’ll see you tomorrow.
Rachel| Um-hmm, yeah.
Rachel|  See ya.
Chandler|  What did you do?
Joey| What ‘cha doing?
Chandler| Having a swim.
Joey| What about the chick?
Chandler| Chicks don’t swim.
Joey| Are you sure?
Chandler| I don’t know. Should we try it?
Joey| Sure.
Chandler| See, I told you they don’t swim. 
Joey|  Wait. Give him a minute.
Chandler| Noo!  Oh, it’s okay, it’s okay, baby, baby, baby.
