Joey|3|
Chandler|4| That’s not true
Chandler|4| I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day
Chandler|4| I wanted to start drinking in the morning
Chandler|4| Don’t say that I don’t have goals
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Chandler, you have to start getting over her
Joey|3| All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it’ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don’t play, everyone will be mad at you ‘cause the teams won’t be even
Joey|3| Come on
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yeah, all right, I’ll play
Chandler|4|

Ross|6|
Joey|3| Says who
Joey|3| Your mom
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Yeah
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Yeah
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Well, every, every Thanksgiving um, we used to have a touch football game called the ‘Geller Bowl
Monica|2|’
Chandler|4| No, no, no, you say that proudly
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and um, it got kind’ve competitive and one year, Geller Bowl VI, I accidentally broke Ross’s nose
Monica|2|
Ross|6| It was soo not an accident
Ross|6| She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw her big fat grandma arm elbow right into my face
Ross|6| And just keep running
Ross|6|
Monica|2| To score the winning touchdown, by the way
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn’t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking
Ross|6|
Monica|2|  I won the game
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Oh yeah
Ross|6| Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Um, there was a Geller Cup
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game
Ross|6| But our Dad said, ‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Ross|6|  threw it in the lake
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| And was the curse lifted
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Anyway
Ross|6| That’s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Y'know what, I think we should play a game
Monica|2| I mean come on, it’s been twelve years
