Joey|3| Nooo
Joey|3| No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn’t something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer
Joey|3|
Monica|2| No, it was Ginger
Monica|2| I remember, because when he told me, I said,  ‘the movie star
Monica|2|’
Joey|3| Aww, man
Joey|3| That’s the girl I was hiding from
Joey|3| When she finds out he’s my roommate, she’s gonna tell him what I did
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Well, what did you do
Monica|2|
Joey|3| What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can’t, I can’t tell you that, it’s like the most awful, horrible thing I’ve ever done my whole life
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Y'know what, don’t tell us
Monica|2| We’ll just wait until Chandler gets home,  because it’ll be more fun that way
Monica|2|
Joey|3| All right
Joey|3|
Joey|3| Okay, it was like four years ago
Joey|3| Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad’s cabin
Joey|3| Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper
Joey|3| Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Monica|2| You gave her food poisoning
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Joey|3| I wish
Joey|3| No
Joey|3| After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire
Joey|3| Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out
Joey|3| So, I picked up a log and threw it on
Joey|3| Or, at least what I thought was a log
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Oh my God
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| You threw Pepper on the fire
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| I wish
Joey|3| See, I guess another thing I probably should’ve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Oh my God
Monica|2| Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire
Monica|2|
Joey|3| I ran
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Well, that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve ever met in a men’s room

Ross|6| Come on
Ross|6| Forty-five minutes
Ross|6| Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody
Rachel|1| Remember that thing that’s been dead for a gazillion years
Rachel|1| Well there’s this little bone we didn’t know it had
Rachel|1|’
Ross|6| First of all it’s Professor Pittain
Ross|6| And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka

Ross|6| With this new job, and all these new people, and you’ve got this whole other life going on
Ross|6| I-I-I know it’s dumb, but I hate that I’m not a part of it
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| It’s not dumb
Rachel|1| But, maybe it’s okay that you’re not a part of it
Rachel|1| Y'know what I mean
Rachel|1|  I mean it’s like, I-I-I like that you’re not involved in that part of my life
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| That’s a little clearer
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you
Rachel|1| Because I do
Rachel|1| I love you, I love you so much
Rachel|1| But my work it’s-it’s for me y'know, I’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it, because it’s mine

Phoebe|5| God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would’ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself
Phoebe|5| And if I can’t trust you then just forget it
Phoebe|5| 
Leslie|0| No, no, I don’t want to forget it
Leslie|0|
Phoebe|5| Okay y'know what you have to choose
Phoebe|5| All right, if-if the most important thing on the planet to you is this cat poopy thing then, okay you can have Smelly Cat, but we won’t be partners
