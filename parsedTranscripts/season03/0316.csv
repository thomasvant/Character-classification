Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break
Rachel|1|

Monica|2| That’s okay, this is more important than fruit   on my ceiling
Monica|2| You broke up

Ross|6|
Ross|6|  Ahhhh
Ross|6|
Ross|6| 
Phoebe|5| Hey
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Hey
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Oh, there’s banana on it
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| So then you know
Monica|2| 
Phoebe|5| The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Oh, good
Monica|2| Thanks
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Now what is Fabutec
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Okay, all right don’t judge me to much
Monica|2| Okay
Monica|2| Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop
Monica|2| But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Waxine
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Yes
Monica|2| Have you seen it
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Oh, it’s incredible
Phoebe|5| I so want to be a Waxine girl
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| I know
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| God
Phoebe|5| Do think it really doesn’t hurt
Phoebe|5| ‘Cause how can they do that
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Hello
Monica|2| Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| They have the best stuff in there
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Oh my God
Chandler|4| Oh my God
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3| We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel
Joey|3| Which is probably what you shoulda done
Joey|3| Huh
Joey|3|
Ross|6| You think
Ross|6|
Ross|6| God, I, ah, I’m in hell
Ross|6| I mean what, what am I gonna do
Ross|6| Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this
Ross|6|’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do
Ross|6| What is she gonna say
Ross|6|’ when I tell her what I did
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question
Chandler|4| How dumb are you
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| What
Ross|6|
Ross|6| Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right
Ross|6| How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| He’s right
Chandler|4| Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Yeah, but don’t you think
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right
Chandler|4| And that’s what deathbeds are for
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Yeah, okay
Ross|6| 
Joey|3| All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way
Joey|3|  Did you think about the trail
Joey|3|
Ross|6| What trail
Ross|6|
Joey|3|  The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it
Joey|3|  You always have to think about the trail
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac
Chandler|4| Issac’s sister is Jasmine
Chandler|4| And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe
Chandler|4| And Phoebe’s friends with Rachel
Chandler|4| And that’s the trail, I did it
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5|  After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one, 
Monica|2| Did that
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Okay
Monica|2|  Ow
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Monica|2| Ow-oh-oh
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Was it not pain-free
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| No
Monica|2| It was painful
Monica|2| Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid
Monica|2| But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5|  Ow-ow-ow-ow
Phoebe|5| Oh my God
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips
Monica|2|
Ross|6|  Chloe
Ross|6| Hi
Ross|6|
Ross|6| 
Chloe|0| Is this about me taking your watch
Chloe|0|
Ross|6| You took my watch
Ross|6|
Chloe|0| I’m sorry, I do that
Chloe|0|
Ross|6| Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us
Ross|6|
Chloe|0| Oh no
Chloe|0| I feel it isn’t really anybody’s business, y'know
Chloe|0|
Ross|6| Exactly
Ross|6| So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right
Ross|6|
Chloe|0| Oh, well I tell Issac everything
Chloe|0|
Ross|6| You tell, of course you do
Ross|6| Issac
Ross|6| Issac
Ross|6| Hey, Issac
Ross|6| Issac, hi
Ross|6| Y'know we haven’t actually met
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Issac|0| You dog
Issac|0|
Ross|6| Yes, I suppose I am a dog
Ross|6| But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend
Ross|6|
Issac|0| Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place
Issac|0|
Ross|6| Yeah, that’s the one
Ross|6| Listen, I don’t want to hurt her
Ross|6|
Issac|0| Oh, hey, man I know, doesn’t matter how much we love ‘em, monogamy is too cruel a rule
Issac|0|
Ross|6| Yeah
Ross|6| Listen, can you keep this information to yourself
Ross|6|
Issac|0| Aw, no problem dude
Issac|0| Y'know we got to look out for each other
Issac|0| We’re the same, you and me
Issac|0|
Ross|6| Actually, no, we’re not
Ross|6|
Issac|0| Yeah, we are
Issac|0|
Ross|6| No, we’re not
Ross|6|
Issac|0| Yeah, we are
Issac|0|
Ross|6| No, we’re not
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Issac|0| Okay, we’re not
Issac|0|
Ross|6| Right
Ross|6|
Issac|0| But, we are
Issac|0|
Ross|6| Fine
Ross|6| I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister
Ross|6|
Issac|0| I can promise not to tell her again
Issac|0|
Ross|6|  Jasmine
Ross|6| 
Jasmine|0| Uh-huh
Jasmine|0|
Ross|6| We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller
Ross|6|
Jasmine|0| You did a bad thing
Jasmine|0|
Ross|6| Yes, I did
Ross|6|
Jasmine|0| Very bad
Jasmine|0|
Ross|6| Very bad
Ross|6|
Jasmine|0| Very, very bad
Jasmine|0|
Ross|6| I’m agreeing with you
Ross|6| Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet
Ross|6|
Jasmine|0| No
Jasmine|0|
Ross|6| Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t
Ross|6| I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6|
Jasmine|0| All right
Jasmine|0|
Ross|6| Thank you, thank you
Ross|6|
Jasmine|0| But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too
Jasmine|0|
Ross|6|  Who’s your roommate
Ross|6|
Ross|6| Gunther
Ross|6| Gunther
Ross|6| Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place
Ross|6|
Gunther|0| I’m sorry
Gunther|0| Was I not supposed to
Gunther|0|
Monica|2| Ow
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Ow
Monica|2|
Monica|2| Ow
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Ow
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Ow

Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Monica|2| Ow-ow-ow-ow
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Ow
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| Ow-ow-ow-ow
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| We’re all right
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| It’s okay, it’s okay
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| We’re all right
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| We were just waxing our legs
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Off
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that’s all
Joey|3| I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Oh yeah, come here
Phoebe|5| 
Chandler|4| Oh, that’s mature
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Uh-huh
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| That’s right
Monica|2|
Ross|6|  Come on, Rachel, come on
Ross|6| Talk to me
Ross|6| Please
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| I can’t talk to you
Rachel|1| I can’t even look at you right now
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| What
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Nothing, nothing
Chandler|4|
Monica|2|  Rachel said everything was okay
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5|  What, what are they talking about
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Rachel
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Just get away from me
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| No, it was a mistake
Ross|6| I made a mistake
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| A mistake
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| What were you trying to put it in
Rachel|1| Her purse
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Whe-where did he put it
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Ross, you had sex with another woman
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Oh my God
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Oh
Monica|2|
Monica|2|  You guys knew about this and you didn’t tell us
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Chandler|4|  He has sex, and we get hit in our heads
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1|  Y'know what, I want you to leave
Rachel|1| Get outta here
Rachel|1| 
Ross|6| No
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Just get out
Rachel|1| Now
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| No
Ross|6|
Ross|6| No
Ross|6|
Ross|6| I wanna stay
Ross|6| I wanna talk about this
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1| All right
Rachel|1| How was she
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Uh-oh
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| What
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Was she good
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Don’t answer that
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Come on Ross
Rachel|1| You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| How was she
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| She was
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Awful
Joey|3| Horrible
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| She was not good
Chandler|4| Not good
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| She was nothing compared to you
Joey|3|
Ross|6| She, she was different
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Ewwwww
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Uh-oh
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Good different
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Nobody likes change
Ross|6|
Ross|6| What
Ross|6| Okay, okay, okay, okay
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Should we do something
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Yeah, never cheat on Rachel
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry
Ross|6| I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Whoa
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| Whoa, whoa, wait a minute
Rachel|1| What time did your little friend leave
Rachel|1|  Oh my God
Rachel|1| She was there
Rachel|1| She was still there
Rachel|1| She was in there, when I was in there
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Listen
Ross|6| Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| 
Ross|6| Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise
Ross|6| I thought we were broken up
Ross|6| 
Rachel|1| We were on a break
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| That, for all I knew would, could last forever
Ross|6| That to me is a break-up
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay
Ross|6| I thought our relationship was dead
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Y'know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore
Joey|3| 
Monica|2|  What, what are you doing
Monica|2| You can’t go out there
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Why not
Joey|3|
Joey|3|  I’m hungry
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Because they’ll know we’ve been listening
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| God
Rachel|1| And to have to hear about it from Gunther
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Come on
Ross|6| Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Oh, that is so sweet
Rachel|1| I think I’m falling in love with you all over again
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Y'know what, I think we can go out there
Chandler|4| I mean they have more important things to worry about
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah, we’ll be fine
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to
Ross|6|
Chandler|4|  Wax the door shut, we’re never leaving, ever
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Hi, it’s Phoebe
Phoebe|5| Listen someone’s gonna have to take my 9:00 with Mr
Phoebe|5| Rehack, ‘cause it’s like 9:15 now, and I’m not there
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| All right
Rachel|1| Let’s say I had slept with Mark
Rachel|1| Would you have been able to forgive me
Rachel|1|
Ross|6|  Yes I would
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me
Rachel|1|
Ross|6|  Yes
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Ross|6|  La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Ross|6| Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you
Ross|6| Because it’s, I mean it’s you
Ross|6|
All|0| Ohhhhh
All|0|
Ross|6| What
Ross|6| Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| I’m thinking, I’m gonna order a pizza
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Order a pizza like, ‘I forgive you
Ross|6|’
Joey|3| Oh man, pizza
Joey|3| I like pizza
Joey|3|  Put olives on the pizza
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| We could eat the wax
Phoebe|5| It’s organic
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Oh great, food with hair on it
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| No, not the used wax
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Because that would be crazy
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Hey, can I, can I get in on that
Ross|6| Because I’m kinda hungry myself
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Fine
Rachel|1|  Hi
Rachel|1| Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| No anchovies
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| With ah, extra anchovies
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘em off
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| You can have the last piece, if you want
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Well, I should think so
Rachel|1| You slept with someone
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got too
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| What if they don’t
Monica|2|
Joey|3| You think I need a new walk
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| What
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Well y'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school
Joey|3| Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice
Joey|3| I think I need a ‘take notice’ walk
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Are you actually saying these words
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| What, now you’re not even taking to me
Ross|6|  Look Rachel, I-I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry, I was out of my mind
Ross|6| I thought I’d lost you, I didn’t know what to do
Ross|6| Come on
Ross|6| Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this
Ross|6| Huh
Ross|6| I-I don’t cheat right, I, that’s not me, I’m not Joey
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Whoa-ho-ho
Joey|3|  Yeah, okay
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Hey
Monica|2| It’s three in the morning
Monica|2| They don’t know that I’ve come home yet
Monica|2| You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay
Ross|6| You’re the one that bailed on us
Ross|6| You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| That’s
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| That’s what
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| That is neither here nor there
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Okay, well here we are
Ross|6| Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach
Ross|6| What do you want to do
Ross|6| How do you want to handle it
Ross|6| Huh
Ross|6| Do you wanna fight for us
Ross|6| Or, do you wanna bail
Ross|6|  Look, I,  I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6| And I’m sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can’t
Ross|6|  I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good
