Monica|2|
Richard|0| You’ve got panties stuck to your leg
Richard|0|
Monica|2|  That’s because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it’s static cling
Monica|2| Or maybe it’s just that God knew I’d be running into you and saw an opportunity
Monica|2|
Richard|0| It’s good to see you
Richard|0|
Monica|2| It’s good to see you too
Monica|2|
Monica|2| You see that guy

Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5| Since tomorrow
Phoebe|5| I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that’s he’s going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| And what are you going to do for him
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| I’m going to let him
Phoebe|5|

Monica|2| 
Rachel|1| When did this happen
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Oh, um, around 8:02
Monica|2| We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Oh, there’s no such thing as an innocent burger
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| So, are you gonna see him again
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Tomorrow night
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Monica, what are you doing
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| It’s not a date, okay
Monica|2| I’m just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you’ll probably be hungry after the sex
Joey|3|
Monica|2| We’re not gonna have sex
Monica|2| Okay, nothing’s changed here
Monica|2| He still doesn’t want children and I still do, so that’s why we’re just gonna be friends
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Naked friends
Ross|6|
Rachel|1|  Hey
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Do you have any ice
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Check the freezer
Joey|3| If there’s none in there, then we’re probably out
Joey|3| Are you just getting in from work
Joey|3| It’s late
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Yeah, I know
Rachel|1| I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien
Rachel|1| I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it
Rachel|1| How was your day
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| I discovered I’m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Hmm
Rachel|1|  Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Well, safer
Joey|3| Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| How often do you read it
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once
Rachel|1| But I mean that’s a classic, what’s so great about The Shining
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining
Joey|3| Okay
Joey|3| And the answer would be: nothing
Joey|3| All right
Joey|3| This is like the scariest book ever
Joey|3| I bet it’s way better than that classic of yours
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1| Ah, well we’ll just see about that, okay
Rachel|1| I will read The Shining,  and you will read Little Women
Rachel|1| 
Joey|3| All right, you got it
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| All right
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Okay
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Okay

Monica|2|
Richard|0| Ew, this feels very weird
Richard|0|
Monica|2| You touch people’s eyeballs every day and this feels weird
Monica|2|
Richard|0| Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them
Richard|0|  That’s my hand

Ross|6|
Joey|3| But Jo’s got a crush on Laurie
Joey|3|  Oh
Joey|3| You mean it’s like a girl-girl thing
Joey|3| ‘Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| No, actually Laurie’s a boy

Phoebe|5| You guys
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| Come on

Richard|0|
Monica|2| I’ll call you back
Monica|2| 
Monica|2| So we can be friends who sleep together
Monica|2|
Richard|0| Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball
Richard|0|
Monica|2| Sounds smart and healthy to me
Monica|2| So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies
Monica|2|
Richard|0| Just your dad
Richard|0|  Although that’s actually racquetball
Richard|0| You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister’s neighbour next Tuesday
Richard|0|
Monica|2| Oh
Monica|2|
Richard|0| You want me to cancel it
Richard|0|
Monica|2| No
Monica|2|  No
Monica|2| 
Richard|0| Okay
Richard|0|
Monica|2| ‘Cause if you do that means you’d be cancelling it for me, and we’re just friends

Chandler|4| If I were you I would wear them every day, every day
Chandler|4|
Robert|0| Jeez, thank you really that is so nice
Robert|0| But um, to be honest, I don’t think I can wear these, they’re so tight, I feel like I’m on display
Robert|0| I’m sorry
Robert|0|
Phoebe|5| That’s all right, that’s well, I figured
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|

Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you’re gonna ruin it
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| All right I’ll talk in code

Chandler|4| Hmmm, that’s very cool
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank
Joey|3| Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away
Joey|3| Aww
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Joey
Rachel|1| I can’t believe you just did that
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| I can’t believe she cracked your code
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she’s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3| Mine was by accident
Joey|3| All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Eh

Chandler|4| Does she Rachel
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Joey’s asking if you’ve just ruined the first book he’s ever loved that didn’t star Jack Nicholson
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| No
Rachel|1| She doesn’t die
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Then why would you say that
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Because, I wanted to hurt you

Monica|2|
Monica|2| What are you smiling at
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| I’m sorry, I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up

Phoebe|5| Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it on the lose
Phoebe|5|’ ‘Is it watching me
Phoebe|5|’
Chandler|4| We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| stuff
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| He’s right, even if it’s to say something complementary

Richard’s Date|0| Wait a minute, don’t I get to see the bedroom
Richard’s Date|0|
Richard|0| The bedroom
Richard|0| Well it’s pretty much your typical

Richard|0|
Richard|0|  bedroom
Richard|0|
Richard’s Date|0| We’re still on this side of the door
Richard’s Date|0|

Richard|0| 
Monica|2|  So um, who was she
Monica|2|
Richard|0| Oh,  that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today
Richard|0|
Monica|2|  Did you like her
Monica|2| And I’m just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this
Monica|2|
Richard|0| Well, you seem fine
Richard|0|
Monica|2|  Okay, y'know what, I’m not fine, I’m not
Monica|2| I mean how can I be fine, hearing you come in with her, she wants to see your bedroom
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Monica|2|  Y'know what, what if we’re friends who don’t see other people
Monica|2|
Richard|0| You mean like exclusive friends
Richard|0|
Monica|2| Why not
Monica|2|
Monica|2| I mean this has been the most amazing week
Monica|2| Would it be so terrible
Monica|2| Even if we were friends who lived together
Monica|2| Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever
Monica|2|
Richard|0| Wow
Richard|0| Y'know we’re back where we were
Richard|0| Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing’s changed
Richard|0|
Monica|2| That’s not true, you don’t have a moustache
Monica|2|
Richard|0| Okay, okay, one thing’s changed
Richard|0| But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end
Richard|0|
Monica|2| Y'know what, I’ve got to walk out of here right now, ‘cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do
Monica|2| I don’t think I could do it again
Monica|2|
Richard|0| I know I couldn’t
Richard|0| So
Richard|0|
Richard|0|
Richard|0|
Richard|0|
Monica|2| How ‘bout one last game of racquetball
