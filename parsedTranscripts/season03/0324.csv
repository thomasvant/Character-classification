Ross|6| Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson
Joey|3| Y'know
Joey|3| What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right
Joey|3| Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell
Joey|3|  Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad
Joey|3|
Chandler|4|  What if Joey were president
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something

Rachel|1| Oh, ah with who
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Umm, my friend, Bonnie
Phoebe|5| She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it

Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick
Rachel|1| I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Well, maybe it won’t work out

Announcer|0| 
Monica|2|  Pete
Monica|2| Pete
Monica|2|
Monica|2| That guy’s pretty huge
Monica|2|
Pete|0| Don’t worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent’s strength and weight against him
Pete|0|
Ross|6| Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble
Ross|6|
Ross|6| All right
Ross|6| You go get him

Monica|2| Mon-i-ca
Monica|2| Can I just tell you how proud I am of you
Monica|2|
Pete|0| It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant “You suck
Pete|0|”
Monica|2| I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it
Monica|2| And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets
Monica|2|
Pete|0| What, look back
Pete|0|
Monica|2| Well, you’re not gonna get going are you
Monica|2|
Pete|0| Well let me ask you a question
Pete|0| Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion
Pete|0|
Monica|2| Well, no
Monica|2| But
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Pete|0| Well I’m not gonna stop until I’m the Ultimate Fighting Champion
Pete|0|
Monica|2| That guy stood on your neck until you passed out
Monica|2|
Pete|0| Let me tell you a story
Pete|0| When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight
Pete|0| No
Pete|0| There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad’s garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck
Pete|0|
Monica|2| You didn’t know that already
Monica|2|
Pete|0| Look, I’m gonna get better
Pete|0| Okay
Pete|0| I promise you
Pete|0|
Monica|2| Okay, just get a lot better
Monica|2|  Fast
Monica|2|
Pete|0| Oh, one other thing
Pete|0| Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration
Pete|0|
Monica|2| Yeah
Monica|2| That-that was the problem
Monica|2|
Monica|2|  Hey
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Hey
Ross|6| How long until Pete’s fight
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Oh, about five minutes
Monica|2| Right now they’re interviewing his opponent
Monica|2| Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Hot dog
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Four, please
Monica|2|  I’m really nervous
Monica|2|  Thank you
Monica|2| 
Phoebe|5| So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| What
Ross|6| Oh
Ross|6| I gotta tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s really terrific
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Ohh, that’s too bad
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| No, I-I’m saying I liked her
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Pheebs, I think she’s great
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6| We’re going out again
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Okay, I hear you
Phoebe|5| Are you capable of talking about any thing else
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4|  Hey
Chandler|4| Which one’s my turkey burger
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Ahh, the one next to my foot
Ross|6| Sorry
Ross|6|
Joey|3|  Hey, the fight’s starting
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Okay, we’ll be right in
Ross|6|  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Nine times
Chandler|4| Okay, I had to put on lotion
Chandler|4| But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free
Chandler|4|
Joey|3|  Fight’s over
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Excuse me, Doug
Chandler|4|  Hey there sports fan
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Doug|0|  Bing
Doug|0| You got those numbers for me
Doug|0|
Chandler|4| No, I ah, I didn’t do them
Chandler|4|
Doug|0| Oh, you forgot
Doug|0|
Chandler|4| No, no I just ah, didn’t do them
Chandler|4| Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise
Chandler|4|
Doug|0| Well, I got tanked myself last night
Doug|0| Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller
Doug|0|  That’s okay, you’re still my number one guy
Doug|0|  Bing
Doug|0|
Chandler|4| Doug
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Doug|0| Hmm
Doug|0|
Chandler|4| I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself
Chandler|4|
Doug|0| Oh, is it the swearing
Doug|0| I mean is it the constant swearing
Doug|0| Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just
Doug|0|
Doug|0|
Doug|0| kiss my ass
Doug|0|
Chandler|4| No, no
Chandler|4| It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock
Chandler|4|
Doug|0| Oh
Doug|0|
Chandler|4| Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment
Chandler|4| It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous
Chandler|4|
Doug|0| Well, say no more
Doug|0| Y'know it takes guts to bring this up
Doug|0| Bing
Doug|0| You’re okay
Doug|0|
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| 
Doug|0| Ha
Doug|0|  Ahhhhhhh
Doug|0|
Chandler|4| Ahhhhh
Chandler|4| 
Phoebe|5| Okay

Rachel|1| Come on Phoebe, look at that
Rachel|1| They are not breaking up, look at them
Rachel|1| Okay that’s, you know what that is
Rachel|1| That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is
Rachel|1| Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Oh no
Phoebe|5| That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Ohh
Rachel|1|  Phoebe, this is all your fault

Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1| Just go in there and like, shave her head
Rachel|1| You owe me one bald girl
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Okay, first of all, breathe
Phoebe|5| Second of all, I don’t get it
Phoebe|5| Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1|  Yes
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Well isn’t he your friend
Phoebe|5| Don’t you want him to be happy
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Yes

Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Oh, we killed them all

Pete|0| Ah, I’m not supposed to move my spine
Pete|0|
Monica|2| Please tell me you’re stopping now
Monica|2|
Pete|0| I’m fine

Pete|0| This is my zone of terror
Pete|0|
Monica|2| You are insane
Monica|2| You-you gotta give this up
Monica|2|
Pete|0| I can’t until I’m the ultimate fighter
Pete|0| I will do it
Pete|0| I’m telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman
Pete|0| Now, I’m not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid
Pete|0|
Monica|2| Sit down
Monica|2| All right
Monica|2| Please, just listen to me
Monica|2| You are terrible at this
Monica|2| Okay
Monica|2| You are the worst ultimate fighter ever
Monica|2| Ever
Monica|2|
Monica|2| 
Pete|0| Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam’s Apple, but that really hurt
Pete|0|
Monica|2| Well then, y'know what
Monica|2| I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this
Monica|2| So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do it without me
Monica|2|
Pete|0| Well if you’re asking me to quit, then you’re asking me to be someone I’m not
Pete|0| I’ve got to do this
Pete|0|
Monica|2| Then I’ve gotta go
Monica|2| Bye
Monica|2| 
Pete|0| Mon-Monica
Pete|0|
Monica|2| Yes
Monica|2|
Pete|0| Could you leave a note
