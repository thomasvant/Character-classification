Joey|3| Now um, on my first day as  Dr
Joey|3| Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives,  I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don’t have a line, but someone else just did
Joey|3| And it goes like this
Joey|3|  Thanks, thanks, a lot
Joey|3| Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive
Joey|3| All right, moving right along
Joey|3|

Dr. Green|0| What happened to the library
Dr. Green|0|
Ross|6| There never was a library
Ross|6| I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one
Ross|6|
Dr. Green|0| You know what’s really good here, the lobster
Dr. Green|0| What do you say shall I just order three
Dr. Green|0|
Ross|6| Yeah, if you’re really hungry
Ross|6|  It was a joke, I made a joke
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster
Rachel|1|
Dr. Green|0| What kind of person is allergic to lobster
Dr. Green|0| I guess the kind of person that works at a library
Dr. Green|0|
Ross|6| It’s not a library
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Dr. Green|0|  I know
Dr. Green|0|
Dr. Green|0| It’s a museum

Ross|6|
Dr. Green|0|  Rust, is boat cancer, Ross
Dr. Green|0|
Ross|6| Wow
Ross|6| I’m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that

Rachel|1| Aw honey stop
Rachel|1| It’s not that bad
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Yeah
Ross|6|  Op
Ross|6| Uh-oh
Ross|6| I think your Dad must’ve added wrong
Ross|6| He only tipped like four percent
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1| That’s Daddy
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| That’s Daddy
Ross|6|
Ross|6| But doesn’t it bother you
Ross|6| You’re a waitress
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I’d be serving him sneezers
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| So
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| So
Rachel|1| Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s not gonna change
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| You really serve people sneezers
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Well um, I don’t
Rachel|1|
Dr Green|0| You kids ready

Dr. Green|0|
Ross|6| Oh, ah, you don’t need that
Ross|6|
Dr. Green|0| Why not
Dr. Green|0|
Ross|6| The carbon, it’s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness
Ross|6|
Dr. Green|0|  What is this
Dr. Green|0| Who put a twenty down here
Dr. Green|0| Huh
Dr. Green|0|
Ross|6| Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Yeah it is, it is
Rachel|1|  We really, really have to do something about that
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| I know
Ross|6|
Dr. Green|0| Excuse me, you think I’m cheap
Dr. Green|0|
Rachel|1| Oh Daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he really didn’t
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Nothing I do means anything, really
Ross|6|
Dr. Green|0| This is nice
Dr. Green|0| I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr
Dr. Green|0| Big Shot
Dr. Green|0| You really want to be Mr
Dr. Green|0| Big Shot
Dr. Green|0| Here, I’ll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr
Dr. Green|0| Big Shot, all right
Dr. Green|0| 
Ross|6| Well Mr
Ross|6| Big Shot is better than ‘wethead’
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Okay, some tricks of the trade
Joey|3| Now, I’ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling
Joey|3| Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil
Joey|3| That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’  Okay, let’s say I’ve just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13
Joey|3|  And that’s how it’s done
Joey|3| Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed
Joey|3|
Student|0| Hey, Mr
Student|0| Trib
Student|0|
Joey|3| Hey-hey
Joey|3|
Student|0| Guess what, I got an audition
Student|0|

Joey|3| I’m so proud
Joey|3|
Student|0| I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it
Student|0|
Joey|3| You bet
Joey|3| What’s the part
Joey|3|
Student|0| Oh it’s great, it’s a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer
Student|0|
Rachel|1| You had to do it, didn’t you
Rachel|1| You couldn’t just leave it alone
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Four percent
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6| I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along
Rachel|1|  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Yeah, I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall
Ross|6|
Ross|6| Hey Pheebs, what are you doing
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| I’m, I’m freaking out
Phoebe|5| Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn’t have
Phoebe|5| All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something
Phoebe|5| Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Um
Rachel|1| yeah
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| I am soo dead
Phoebe|5| 
Rachel|1| All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay
Rachel|1| So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me
Ross|6| Like me tiny doctor
Ross|6|’
Rachel|1| Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross
Rachel|1| For me
Rachel|1| For me
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything
Ross|6| You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay
Rachel|1| Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| 
Ross|6| Okay, okay, okay

Joey|3|  There will come a time in each of your careers when you’ll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor
Joey|3| I had such an opportunity in the recent, present
Joey|3| And I’m ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually
Joey|3| Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him
Joey|3| And now, he’s got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I’m stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV
Joey|3| I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry
Joey|3|  Thank you
