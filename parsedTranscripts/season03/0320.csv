Chandler|4| Wait a minute, wait
Chandler|4| You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3| Oh my God
Joey|3|  Is this what it’s like to be you
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Oh, you have no idea
Joey|3| And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s like somebody’s ripping out my heart
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Oh, it’s so great to see you feeling like this
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6|  Hey
Ross|6|
All|0| Hey
All|0|
Ross|6| Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Yes
Monica|2|
Monica|2| Yes
Monica|2| Yeah, yeah, yeah
Monica|2|
Ross|6| We were all pretty shaken up about it
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Wait, am I missing something though
Phoebe|5| ‘Cause I thought death was something that’s supposed to be sad, in a way
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch
Monica|2|   And I’m sorry she died
Monica|2| Did Dad say I get the dollhouse
Monica|2|
Ross|6| You get the dollhouse
Ross|6|
Monica|2| I get the dollhouse
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool
Phoebe|5| When I was kid, I had a barrel
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| No, just a barrel
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Really
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| Really
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Any time you want
Monica|2| Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no
Monica|2|
Monica|2| It was to be looked at, but never played with
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me
Chandler|4|

Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| Oh, nothing, he’s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore

Joanna|0| Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| No
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| No
Rachel|1| He’s not married, or involved, with anyone
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| Oh, Rachel,  actually, y'know what, forget it
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| Would you
Joanna|0| Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do
Joanna|0|
Sophie|0| Uh, uh, uh, I am here
Sophie|0|
Joanna|0| I know that
Joanna|0|

Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out
Phoebe|5| Ha-ha
Phoebe|5| 
Monica|2| What’s this
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| That’s a dog, every house should have a dog
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Not one that can pee on the roof
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4|  And is this in case the house sneezes
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| I don’t want a ghost
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Well, nobody wants a ghost
Phoebe|5| But you’ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground
Ross|6| That would never happen
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U
Phoebe|5|S
Phoebe|5| government
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1|  Hey

Chandler|4| Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive
Chandler|4| I’ll do it
Chandler|4|

Monica|2|
Rachel|1| What’s this
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture

Rachel|1|  O-o-o-okay, how did it go
Rachel|1| Tell me everything
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening
Chandler|4| 
Rachel|1| Hmm
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna’s such a big, dull dud
Chandler|4|
Joanna|0| Chandler is fantastic
Joanna|0|
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| Oh God, we just clicked

Joanna|0| Did he tell you
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| Oh, I
Rachel|1|

Joanna|0|
Sophie|0| Isn’t this great
Sophie|0|
Sophie|0|
Joanna|0| Don’t spoil it
Joanna|0|
Joey|3| Come on baby, don’t go
Joey|3| Please
Joey|3| What do you say
Joey|3|
The Director|0|  Hello
The Director|0| Oh
The Director|0| It’s you
The Director|0| Just ah, just one-one sec
The Director|0|  I am going to take this call
The Director|0| When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment
The Director|0| 
Joey|3|  That guy’s like a cartoon
Joey|3| What do you see in him anyway
Joey|3|
Kate|0| He happens to be brilliant
Kate|0| Which is more than I can say for that sweater you’re dating
Kate|0|
Joey|3| Hey, I’m not interested in her sweater
Joey|3| It’s what’s underneath her sweater that counts
Joey|3| And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I’m going out with
Joey|3|
Kate|0| I don’t care
Kate|0| Why, do you want me to care
Kate|0|
Joey|3| Do you want me to want you to care
Joey|3|
Kate|0| Do you
Kate|0|
Joey|3| What
Joey|3|
The Director|0|  Okay, I’m afraid to say this, but let’s pick it up where we left off
The Director|0|
Joey|3| Come on baby, don’t go
Joey|3| Please
Joey|3| What do you say
Joey|3|
Kate|0| I’ve got no reason to stay
Kate|0| 
The Director|0| Stop
The Director|0|
The Director|0| Stop it
The Director|0| You must stop
The Director|0| You are bad actors
The Director|0| This is a terrible play
The Director|0| I’ll see you in the morning
The Director|0| 
Kate|0| I can’t believe we go on in, in a week
Kate|0|
Joey|3| Hey, it’s gonna be all right
Joey|3|
Lauren|0|  Hey
Lauren|0| So since we’re getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs
Lauren|0|
Joey|3| What
Joey|3|
Lauren|0| You know
Lauren|0| At the place I told you about last night
Lauren|0|
Joey|3| Oh, yeah, with the mug painting
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3| I was so listening to that
Joey|3| But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight
Joey|3|
Lauren|0| Oh, okay
Lauren|0|
Joey|3| Okay

Lauren|0| 
Joey|3|  Ah, are you okay
Joey|3|
Kate|0| Yeah, I guess
Kate|0| Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh
Kate|0|
Joey|3| I don’t know
Joey|3|
Kate|0| Well umm, maybe if it had more heat
Kate|0|
Joey|3| How do you mean
Joey|3|
Kate|0| Well, Adrian’s looking for a reason to stay, right
Kate|0| Victor can’t just kiss her, he’s gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know
Kate|0|
Joey|3| Maybe he could slip her the tongue
Joey|3|
Kate|0| Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up
Kate|0|
Joey|3| Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist
Joey|3|
Kate|0| And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach
Kate|0|
Joey|3| And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her
Joey|3|
Kate|0| And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal
Kate|0|
Kate|0|
Kate|0|
Kate|0|
Joey|3| Something like that
Joey|3|
Kate|0| Yeah, that’s pretty much what I had in mind
Kate|0|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3|
Joey|3|  Hey
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Hi
Ross|6|
Joey|3|  Hey
Joey|3| 
Ross|6| Hi

Monica|2| You’re kidding
Monica|2|
Monica|2| That’s great

Joey|3| After the  love making
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Oh my
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Yep
Joey|3| I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out
Joey|3| And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this
Joey|3| 
Chandler|4|  I’m telling ya, Joanna’s got it all wrong
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| All I said was, ‘This was fun
Chandler|4| Let’s do it again sometime
Chandler|4| I’ll give you a call
Chandler|4|’
Rachel|1| Ohh, gee
Rachel|1| I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| That’s what you say at the end of a date
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night
Rachel|1|’
Chandler|4| To her face
Chandler|4| Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know, comes out
Chandler|4| I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t mean he’s going to call
Monica|2| Hasn’t it ever happened to you
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Well, they always called
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Hmm, bite me
Monica|2|
Joanna|0|  Did he call
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| No
Rachel|1| Sorry
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| Why
Joanna|0|
Joanna|0| Why
Joanna|0|
Joanna|0| He said he’d call
Joanna|0| Why hasn’t he called
Joanna|0|
Sophie|0| Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women
Sophie|0|
Joanna|0| Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt
Joanna|0| Why hasn’t he called, Rachel
Joanna|0| Why
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| Okay, okay
Rachel|1| Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| Awkward
Joanna|0| Why should he feel awkward
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| Well
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1| No
Rachel|1| I
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Joanna|0| Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix
Joanna|0|
Joanna|0|
Joanna|0|that
Joanna|0|
Rachel|1|  Call her
Rachel|1| Call her now
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Multiple, so many paper cuts
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Why hasn’t he called Rachel
Rachel|1| Why
Rachel|1| Why
Rachel|1| I don’t understand
Rachel|1| Why
Rachel|1| He said he’ll call
Rachel|1| Why
Rachel|1| Why
Rachel|1| Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4|  Oh, well give me the phone then
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Come on, this isn’t funny
Rachel|1| She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her
Rachel|1| You have to call her
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you
Chandler|4|’
Rachel|1| Well then you’re going to have to take her out again
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Nooo
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| She’s really dull
Chandler|4| And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| I don’t care
Rachel|1| I don’t care
Rachel|1| You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended
Rachel|1| And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| All right
Chandler|4| Fine
Chandler|4| But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour
Chandler|4| And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| That’s fine
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| I know

Joey|3|
Kate|0| Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment

Chandler|4| And this isn’t Rachel’s fault
Chandler|4| It’s me
Chandler|4| I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women
Chandler|4| I have issues with commitment, intimacy,  mascara goop
Chandler|4| And I’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out
Chandler|4|
