Ross|6|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Well, I’m just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| To be nice
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Hey, Joey
Ross|6| Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason
Ross|6|

Ross|6|  What the hell’s a matter with you
Ross|6| How do you think Joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France
Chandler|4| When actually I’ll be in Cuba
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay in person
Ross|6| At least you know her name
Ross|6| You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Where in Cuba
Ross|6|
Chandler|4|  Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here
