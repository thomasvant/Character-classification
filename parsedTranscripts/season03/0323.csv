Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Well what is it
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Ross|6| He couldn't even tell me
Ross|6| He said it was just some sort of skin
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Ross|6| abnormality
Ross|6| And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Y'know what
Chandler|4| You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple
Chandler|4| He just lopped it right off
Chandler|4| Y'know
Chandler|4| So I guess I'm lucky
Chandler|4| I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| At least they knew what yours was
Ross|6| Y'know, yours had a name
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Oh
Joey|3| Maybe they'll name yours after you
Joey|3| Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross
Joey|3|" And then people would be like, ""Awww, he's got a Ross"

Monica|2|
Rachel|1| And
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Well that's it
Monica|2| People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Really
Monica|2|
Monica|2|

Joey|3|

Joey|3| Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5|  …and I-I can't take it

Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5|  Uh
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Whoa-whoa-whoa
Joey|3| What ah, what happened to playing the field

Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| So Pheebs, pick one of them
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Yeah
Monica|2| Which one do you like more

Phoebe|5|  Like for clubbing
Phoebe|5| 
Monica|2| It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes
Monica|2|  I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I can’t
Monica|2| Right
Monica|2| I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Oh my God
Rachel|1|  
Monica|2| I know
Monica|2|  I need more pie
Monica|2| 
Phoebe|5| Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests

Phoebe|5| He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Wow
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| So then, are you going to dump Jason
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and… Okay so Jason is sensitive,  but now so’s Vince  Plus, Vince has the body y'know
