Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Whoa
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| He is soo unreasonable
Phoebe|5| God, although I think I understand what he means

Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Y'know what this is like
Chandler|4| This is like when my parents got divorced
Chandler|4| Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up
Phoebe|5| And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|

Ross|6| Oh, now you want a favour
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Yes, please
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay

Ross|6| No, Rachel doesn’t want me to
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Carol|0| Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you ‘cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don’t punish your friends for what Rachel did to you
