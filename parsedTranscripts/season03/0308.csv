Chandler|4| 
Ross|6| So what’s a matter, you need a dentist
Ross|6| I’ve got a good one
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| No thanks, I have a good one too
Phoebe|5| I just, I, I can’t see him
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| See that is the problem with invisible dentists
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Why
Ross|6| Why can’t you go to him
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist’s blouse
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Phoebe, what
Rachel|1| Umm
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|what
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| And all these people actually died
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Yes, while I was in the chair
Phoebe|5| That’s why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Pheebs, come on, you didn’t kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist
Ross|6| It’s, it’s, it’s just ah, a coincidence
Ross|6|

Rachel|1|
Joey|3| It’ll kill him
Joey|3| I mean it’ll, it’ll just kill him
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Well, you could wait ‘til I go to the dentist, maybe I’ll kill him
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3|  Ewww

Joey|3| It’s like a Play-Doo Fat Factory
Joey|3| 
Phoebe|5| Well, I’m going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or

Ross|6|
Monica|2| Really
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just sort of y'know
