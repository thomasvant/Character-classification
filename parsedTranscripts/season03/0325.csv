Chandler|Chandler|  So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
Bonnie|Other| All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don’t know, we were, we were making out.
Chandler|Chandler| Tell it again.  Seriously.
Rachel|Rachel|  I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
Joey|Joey| Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
Monica|Monica| Joey, she was listing the countries she’s done it in.
Joey|Joey| Well, I think we all learned something.
Phoebe|Phoebe|  Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this!  That’s my Mom’s writing! Look.
Chandler|Chandler|  Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Y'know what that means?
Joey|Joey| That you’re actually 50?
Phoebe|Phoebe| No-no, that’s not, that’s not me Phoebe, that’s her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F.  Best Friends Forever.
All|Other| Oh!
Rachel|Rachel| That is so cool.
Phoebe|Phoebe| I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
All|Other| Yeah! Yeah, we can!
Bonnie|Other|  Shoot! I can’t go, I have to work!
Ross|Ross| That’s too bad.
Rachel|Rachel|  Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
Phoebe|Phoebe| So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to Montauk.
Joey|Joey| Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
Monica|Monica|  Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
Chandler|Chandler| You’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Monica|Monica|  Thanks!
Chandler|Chandler| Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I’ll be your boyfriend.
Monica|Monica| Yeah right.
Chandler|Chandler| Why is that so funny?
Monica|Monica| You made a joke right? So I laughed.
Chandler|Chandler| Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Monica|Monica| Well, no. You’re Chandler. Y'know, Chandler! 
Chandler|Chandler| Okay, so we’ve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren’t friends, say it’s a blind date. I show up at your door, and I’m like  “Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.”
Monica|Monica| Well I’d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Joey|Joey|  Hey!
Monica|Monica| Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
Joey|Joey| No, it’s just my luggage.
Chandler|Chandler| Hey!!
Monica|Monica| Hey!!
Joey|Joey| Hey!!
Joey|Joey| Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
Ross|Ross| Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, I wasn’t talking about his karma.
Rachel|Rachel|  Hey! 
Chandler|Chandler| Hey!
Joey|Joey| Hey-hey, check out the hat!
Chandler|Chandler| What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I can’t have children!!
Monica|Monica| Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Rachel|Rachel| Ross gave it to me.
Ross|Ross| Yeah, I think she looks good.
Rachel|Rachel| Ohh, thank you.
Chandler|Chandler| Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?
Rachel|Rachel| Well excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends, I am here to tell you that hats are back.
Phoebe|Phoebe| And this time, they’ve ganged up to form one giant, super hat.
Ross|Ross| Go, go, go!
Rachel|Rachel| Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oy!!
Monica|Monica| What’s with all this sand? 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, yeah, Bob said there might be flood damage.
Ross|Ross| Yeah, either that, or he has a really big cat.
Phoebe Sr|Other| Well, yes, it’s kind’ve an unusual house. It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there.

Rachel|Rachel| That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.
Ross|Ross| She said you gave her the razor!
Bonnie|Other|  Hey guys.

Rachel|Rachel| I don’t know.
Ross|Ross| You don’t know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
Rachel|Rachel| All right! Ross, do you think it’s easy for me to see you with somebody else?
Ross|Ross| Y'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember?
Rachel|Rachel| Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
Ross|Ross| You still love me?
Rachel|Rachel| Noo.
Ross|Ross| You still love me.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
Ross|Ross| Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
Rachel|Rachel| Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know. Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...

Phoebe Sr|Other| What are you doing here?!
Phoebe|Phoebe| I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
Phoebe Sr|Other| What?!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you’re just mean!  So, just tell me the truth!
Phoebe Sr|Other| All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni. 
Phoebe|Phoebe| My Father is Chuck Magioni?
Phoebe Sr|Other| No, no, that’s just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I’m very sorry, but I don’t know where your Father is, and that’s the truth.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh.
Phoebe Sr|Other| But umm, you’re right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah,  ahh,  okay. I’m your mother.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Heh?
Phoebe Sr|Other| Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and... 
Joey|Joey| I’m telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
Ross|Ross| That’s not true! Her, she doesn’t even know what she wants! Rachel’s still mad about the whole thing.
Chandler|Chandler| Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don’t need that kind’ve hurt. Take it from a guy who’s never had a long term relationship......
Ross|Ross| I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
Bonnie|Other|  Hey!
Chandler|Chandler| Ahhhh! 
Bonnie|Other| You guys, the water’s great. You should really go in.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
Bonnie|Other| Okay, well g’night.
Ross|Ross| Good night.
Bonnie|Other|  Don’t be too long.
Ross|Ross| Okey-dokey!
Chandler|Chandler| There is not one hair on that head.
Ross|Ross| Hey, it’ll grow back, right? And she-she’s really fun, and she’s cool, and-and I’m finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I’m finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn’t work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
Joey|Joey| So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you’re doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
Ross|Ross| Yeah.
Joey|Joey| Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie’s free tonight?
Ross|Ross|  Hi. 
Chandler|Chandler|  Hi there.
Monica|Monica| That’s that weird voice again.
Chandler|Chandler| Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you’re gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
Chandler|Chandler| Hi! I’m Dorf! You’re date for the evening.  Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that’s good stuff!!
