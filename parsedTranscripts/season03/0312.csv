Chandler|4| 
Rachel|1|  Tell him
Rachel|1| 
Ross|6|  It's her first day at this new job
Ross|6| Your not supposed to start with her
Ross|6| 
Chandler|4| All right, I suppose I can wait a day
Chandler|4| Hey, what are you doing Friday
Chandler|4| 
Ross|6| Why
Ross|6| 
Chandler|4| I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist
Chandler|4| 
Ross|6| Oh God
Ross|6| Y'know, botanists are such geeks
Ross|6| 
Chandler|4| Yeah
Chandler|4| Is that a dinosaur tie
Chandler|4| 
Ross|6| Hmm
Ross|6| Oh, yeah
Ross|6|  
Phoebe|5|  Morning
Phoebe|5| Rach, I'm here with the purses

Chandler|4| 
Rachel|1|  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs
Rachel|1| 
Phoebe|5| Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles
Phoebe|5| 
Rachel|1| No, no, no, no turtles scare me
Rachel|1| I don't need that today
Rachel|1| 
Ross|6| Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine
Ross|6| Hey, umm,
Ross|6| why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch

Rachel|1| Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out
Rachel|1| 
Ross|6| Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job
Ross|6| 
Rachel|1| Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing
Rachel|1|  Is this actually a lunchbox

Phoebe|5| Umm, no, it's a purse
Phoebe|5| And there's a thermos in it
Phoebe|5|

Chandler|4|  Hey, so can you make it on Friday
Chandler|4| 
Ross|6| What
Ross|6| Oh yeah, yeah I think so
Ross|6| Why am I invited to this again
Ross|6| 
Chandler|4| Well apparently Albert has no friends
Chandler|4| He's very excited about the bachelor party though
Chandler|4| I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper
Chandler|4| 
Phoebe|5| A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich√©
Phoebe|5| Why don't you get a magician
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| 
Chandler|4| Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right
Chandler|4| 
Ross|6| She's having lunch with him
Ross|6| She's having lunch with him
Ross|6| And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job
Ross|6| And, and, and,  he's really good looking
Ross|6|  What am I gonna do
Ross|6| 
Chandler|4| Don't do anything
Chandler|4| Keep it inside
Chandler|4| Learn how to hide your feelings
Chandler|4|  Don't cry outloud

Monica|2| I'm just an empty vase, huh
Monica|2| 
Julio|0| What
Julio|0| 
Monica|2| Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else
Monica|2| And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog
Monica|2| Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things
Monica|2| I care about my friends and family
Monica|2| You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me
Monica|2| 
Julio|0| Whoa, whoa, whoa
Julio|0| 
Monica|2| You don't even know me
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Monica|2| 
Julio|0| Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you
Julio|0| 
Monica|2| What
Monica|2|

Gunther|0| Let it be me
Gunther|0| Let it be me
Gunther|0|
