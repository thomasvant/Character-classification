Rachel| Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.
Phoebe| Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he’s at Flimby’s.
Rachel| What’s Flimby’s?
Phoebe| Oh, yeah, that’s the word I use when I can’t remember the real thing.
Rachel| Okay. Hang up! That’s it! Come on!
Phoebe| No! Rachel, that’s what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don’t get through, they’re not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It’s us versus them!
Chandler| Ye-e-es!!

Joey| Two it is. Ross, how about you?
Ross| Uh, yeah, I ah, I also need two.

Chandler| Who’s number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
Ross| Uh, no, it’s-it’s just this person.
Phoebe| Like a date type  person?
Ross| Yeah, kinda. It’s this woman from work. I hope that won’t be too weird. Will it, Rach?
Rachel| No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so…

Chandler| Yeah, and I don’t have any cologne.
Joey| The green bottle next to the shaving cream.
Chandler| Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
Monica|  Here you go. You can wear this. 
Phoebe| Thanks!
Monica| Uh-huh.
Phoebe| Okay.  Ooh, I’m setting the phone down.  But I’m still here! Just don’t go anywhere I’m still here.  Don’t-don’t switch or anything, ‘cause I’m, I’m right here.  Just one sec. One sec! One second!!  Wait! One second! Just…

Ross| No, I’m good. 
Chandler|  There he is!
Monica| There’s our star!
Joey| So, so, what’d ya think?
Chandler| Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
Joey| I-I wasn’t in that.
Chandler| I know.
Joey|  Oh-oh, hey-hey, Kate! Listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.
Monica| Hi!
The Director|  Excuse me. Excuse me.  Sweetheart!  Come! 
Chandler| So that’s the girl you like.
Joey| Yeah.
Ross|  I’m telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy! Okay? He viscously screamed at total strangers! I think he’s baaad news!
Chandler| Wait a minute, wait a minute, you don’t like the guy Rachel’s dating? Well, that’s odd.
Joey| Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate’s understudy, Lauren.
Rachel| Oh, hi!
Lauren| Hey.
Rachel| Hey. Gosh, you look soo familiar.
Lauren| Oh, yeah! I-I ran into you in the hallway in your building. It was right after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day.
Cailin| So. How’d you guys meet?
Pete| Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.
Monica| Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
Estelle| Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous! 
Joey| Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
Estelle| How do you do.  Ooh, you two girls were outstanding!  Did they have representation?
Joey| No, they-they weren’t in the play.
Rachel| We’re not actors.
Estelle| Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face  and her chest  I could really put something together.
Chandler| Could I borrow it?
Cailin|  Hi! Remember me?
Ross| Hi! Yeah! Tommy’s in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he’s gonna snap. 
Cailin| Ross, I’m gonna go.
Ross| Go? Why?
Cailin| I don’t know. Could be because I don’t feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.
Ross| But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
Cailin| Good bye Ross.
Ross| Uh, oh-ho bye.
The Director|  Here we go people!  Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la… Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.
Joey| Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
The Director| Kate Miller’s awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable.  Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is…  Thank you, boys and girls, you’ve ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother’s crab cakes!  Excuse me!!
Joey| Anyone mind if I save this?
Monica| Hey!
Rachel| Hey!
Phoebe| Oh, is the play over?
Monica| Yeah. Where were you?
Hold Voice| Thank you for your patience, you’re the next caller.
Monica| You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.
Phoebe| Nah. I kept myself busy.
Phoebe| Oh, okay, yeah.  I put your stuff in her room, and her stuff in your room.
Joey| Hey! Are you okay?
Kate| Fabulous.
Joey| Listen, drama critics they’re nothing but, but people who couldn’t make it as actors. You know what you should do?
Kate| Become a drama critic!
The Director|  I am hurt!  A plague on both your houses! 
Kate| By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
Joey| Oh, classy. 
Kate| Yep! I sure know how to pick ‘em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!
Joey| Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
Kate| Really. What?
Joey| Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We’ll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
Kate| Why the Post?
Joey| Oh, you didn’t see the Post?
Kate| No. You?
Joey| No. Why?
Kate|  So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?
Joey| Oh, absolutely! You’re talented and you’re good looking.
Kate| Oh, you’re sweet and cute.
Joey| I know! That’s why they trashed me!
Joey| Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Kate| What?
Joey| I, I don’t get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
Kate| What? So you never went out with an actress before?
Joey| Kate, do you even like me?
Kate| Of course I do.
Joey| Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?
Kate| I don’t know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy… Why can’t I just pick someone like you?
Joey| Thanks.
Kate| You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, you’re just so, you’re so, so… 
Joey|  Okay. Okay, okay, hey.  There we go, let’s get your feet up there.  Good night, Kate. Sweet dreams.  I’m gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
Hold Voice| Please stay on the line. You’re call is very important to us.
Monica|  Pheebs, you’ve been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn’t healthy.
Phoebe| No, no, I’m fine, and y’know why? ‘Cause of all the riboflavin.
Joey|  Hey!
Monica| Hey! Didn’t you have that outfit on last night?
Joey| Yeah! I stayed at Kate’s, but ah, nothing happened. Hey, Pheebs, where were ya?
Phoebe| I’m so, so, so sorry, Joey. I definitely am gonna see you’re play. I swear you’re play is very important to us, thank you for your patience. You’re play is the next play is the next play I’m gonna see.
Monica| Anyway, how did it go with Kate?
Joey| Oh, it was great! Yeah, I-I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected, y'know? Then ah, then she passed out, but then she woke up. Yeah? And we stayed up all night talking, and now we’re like totally crazy about each other!
Monica| Joey, you had the night! 
Joey| What?
Monica| When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
Joey| You-you think?
Monica| Did you like learn about her family?
Joey| Two brothers, one died!
Monica| Yes!!
Joey| Yeah?!
Monica| Oh!

Chandler| Oh-ho-ho-ho. 
Gunther| Sorry. She thought you were somebody else.
Rachel| What time is it?
Monica| One.
Ross| One.
Chandler| 7:15.  Watch doesn’t work.
Rachel| Tommy’s supposed to be here soon, we’re going to lunch.
Ross| Look. Look, I wasn’t going to say anything to you, but... All right, I don’t think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
Rachel| You don’t?!
Ross| No! The guy is mean. I mean really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
Rachel| Umm, or, maybe, I should stay away from all men.
Ross| No, it’s not just ‘cause I’m jealous.  I mean I’m not, I’m not, I’m not jealous, okay? It’s… Look, the guy, he screamed, he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Chandler| Yeah, and at the end of the play, he, he got up y'know, and he just started like,  banging his hands together!
Ross| Okay, fine, fine. You don’t want to believe me? No, that’s fine. 
Monica| We’re kidding!
Chandler| Ross, don’t. Ross!
Ross| You don’t want to believe me, I’m Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny…  
Tommy| Whoa!!

Monica| Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
Rachel| Yeah…
Tommy|   Hey!
Rachel| Tommyyyy! Say, what’s your favourite thing about summer?

Chandler| Ohh, that’s a good one.

Ross|  Oh-ho, whoa! Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
Tommy| Yeah, but you didn’t.
Ross| No, but it’s-it’s-it’s hot!
Rachel| Ross, would you just stop it! It’s getting really old.
Ross| I can’t believe no one believes me!

Joey| But, but wh-what about us?
Kate| Last night was wonderful. But I-I can’t stay here just for you.
Joey| Well, so, stay for the museums! 
Kate| I’m sorry.
Stage Manager| Joey, onstage!
Joey| Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I’ll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.
Lauren|  Where are you Vic?
Kate| Flight’s in an hour. I-I gotta go.
Lauren| Vic! Vic! Vic!!! 
Joey|  In a minute!!
Lauren| So this is it? Victor?
Joey| Yeah, I guess it is.  Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick ‘cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you’ve got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship,  and I’m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you’ll be long gone. But I won’t have aged at all.  So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I’m gonna want to meet her. 
Lauren| So long, Vic! 
Monica| Phoebe, it’s been two days.
Phoebe| Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it’s one of those 801 numbers. Right?
Ross| Phoebe, 800 is toll free, 801 is-is Utah.
Phoebe| No, no, no, oh no-no-no, it’s has to be 800.  ‘Cause all those big companies have 800 numbers, every one.  Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.
Rachel| Phoe-be!!
Phoebe| Sorry, I’m so sorry, I will pay you back.
Chandler| And yet, she’s still not hanging up the phone.
All| Hang it up! Hang up the phone!!
Phoebe| Fine! Fine!  Oh-oh!
Monica| What?
Phoebe| Well, I think I broke it. But that’s all right, here’s the number you can call.
Monica|  Oh.
