Monica|Monica| Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
Estelle|Other| Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous! 
Joey|Joey| Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
Estelle|Other| How do you do.  Ooh, you two girls were outstanding!  Did they have representation?
Joey|Joey| No, they-they weren’t in the play.
Rachel|Rachel| We’re not actors.
Estelle|Other| Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face  and her chest  I could really put something together.
Chandler|Chandler| Could I borrow it?
Cailin|Other|  Hi! Remember me?
Ross|Ross| Hi! Yeah! Tommy’s in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he’s gonna snap. 
Cailin|Other| Ross, I’m gonna go.
Ross|Ross| Go? Why?
Cailin|Other| I don’t know. Could be because I don’t feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.
Ross|Ross| But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
Cailin|Other| Good bye Ross.
Ross|Ross| Uh, oh-ho bye.
The Director|Other|  Here we go people!  Boxing Day! The Lucille Lortel Theatre, blah-la-la-la… Ah-ha! Joey Tribianni, gives an uneven performance, but Mr. Tribianni is not the worst thing in this production.
Joey|Joey| Yes!!! Ha-ha-ha!
The Director|Other| Kate Miller’s awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable.  Badda-badda-badda. Ah-ha! Here it is! The direction by Marshal Talmant is…  Thank you, boys and girls, you’ve ruined my life. Please, stuff your talentless faces with my Mother’s crab cakes!  Excuse me!!
Joey|Joey| Anyone mind if I save this?

Kate|Other| Become a drama critic!
The Director|Other|  I am hurt!  A plague on both your houses! 
Kate|Other| By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
Joey|Joey| Oh, classy. 
Kate|Other| Yep! I sure know how to pick ‘em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!
Joey|Joey| Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.
Kate|Other| Really. What?
Joey|Joey| Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We’ll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.
Kate|Other| Why the Post?
Joey|Joey| Oh, you didn’t see the Post?

Joey|Joey| I know! That’s why they trashed me!
Joey|Joey| Whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Kate|Other| What?
Joey|Joey| I, I don’t get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
Kate|Other| What? So you never went out with an actress before?
Joey|Joey| Kate, do you even like me?
Kate|Other| Of course I do.
Joey|Joey| Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?
Kate|Other| I don’t know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy… Why can’t I just pick someone like you?

Monica|Monica| Joey, you had the night! 
Joey|Joey| What?
Monica|Monica| When two people finally realise their feelings for each other, and-and they talk for hours, and they-they learn all about the other person!
Joey|Joey| You-you think?
