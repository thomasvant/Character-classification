Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| All right, y'know forget hypnosis
Phoebe|5| The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men
Phoebe|5|

Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Yes

Monica|2| Is this the way you get girls to go out with you
Monica|2|
Employee|0| Umm, I’m still here
Employee|0|
Pete|0|  You’re taking this all wrong
Pete|0| Because, if I didn’t leave you that tip, you wouldn’t of come down here, we wouldn’t be having this argument, and there wouldn’t be this ah, heat between us
Pete|0|
Monica|2| What
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Pete|0| Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now
Pete|0| ‘Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we’re like this-this couple that fights
Pete|0|

Frank|0| Is that all right
Frank|0|
Phoebe|5| Oh, yeah, sure
Phoebe|5| So, how was your day
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0| Oh, well just probably the worst one since I’ve been alive
Frank|0|
Phoebe|5| What umm, what happened
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0| Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off
Frank|0|
Phoebe|5| Oh no
Phoebe|5| Did umm, did she say why
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0| Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don’t see how I could all of the sudden be too young, ‘cause I’m older than I was when we first got together
Frank|0|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know
Phoebe|5| But, y'know what, maybe it’s just all for the best
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0| Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain
Frank|0|
Phoebe|5| Oh, sweetie, oh
Phoebe|5| 
Frank|0| Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know
Frank|0| For the first time in my life
Frank|0| After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing
Frank|0| I can, it’s still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away
Frank|0| And now it’s, and now it’s gone and I don’t know why
Frank|0|
Phoebe|5| Uh, well I can tell you why
Phoebe|5| It’s, it’s because of me
Phoebe|5| But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0| What
Frank|0|
Phoebe|5| Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together, y'know
Phoebe|5| And you’re gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0| Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you
Frank|0|
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0| Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn’t want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch
Frank|0| 
Phoebe|5| Okay, but
Phoebe|5|
Frank|0| Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you’d understand
Frank|0| Oh no
Frank|0|
Frank|0| Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go…
