Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Have fun
Phoebe|5| Oh wait, no, don’t
Phoebe|5| I forgot I am totally against that now
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| What
Joey|3| Me having a job
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights
Phoebe|5|  Hey, how do you sleep at night
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Well, I’m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day
Joey|3| Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong
Joey|3| Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Really
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Yes
Chandler|4| Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it’s the only chance to see New York
Chandler|4|
Gunther|0| 
Gunther|0|
Gunther|0|
Gunther|0|and after you’ve delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray
Gunther|0|
Gunther|0|
Gunther|0|
Gunther|0|
Rachel|1| Gunther, Gunther, please, I’ve worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there
Rachel|1| 
Gunther|0| What if you put them here
Gunther|0| 
Rachel|1| Huh
Rachel|1| Well, y'know that’s actually a really good idea, because that way they’ll be closer to the mugs
Rachel|1| Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too
Rachel|1|
Gunther|0| They already do
Gunther|0| That’s why they call it the ‘tray spot
Gunther|0|’
Rachel|1| Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to
Rachel|1| Oh God, I’m, I’m sorry
Rachel|1| 
Gunther|0| It’s all right
Gunther|0| Sweetheart
Gunther|0|
Ross|6| So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh
Ross|6| I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those cookies anymore
Ross|6| 
Sarah|0| Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies
Sarah|0| The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle
Sarah|0|
Ross|6| Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh
Ross|6|
Sarah|0| Yeah
Sarah|0| My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he’d be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal
Sarah|0|
Ross|6| I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India
Ross|6|
Sarah|0| No
Sarah|0| The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots
Sarah|0| He says he’s gonna double the college money my Grandma left me
Sarah|0|
Ross|6| Huh
Ross|6| Well, good luck to Dad
Ross|6| Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win
Ross|6|
Sarah|0| The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five
Sarah|0|
Ross|6| Yeah
Ross|6|
Sarah|0| So far, I’ve sold seventy-five
Sarah|0|
Ross|6| Four hundred, huh
Ross|6| Well, that sounds do-able
Ross|6|  How much are the boxes
Ross|6|
Sarah|0| Five dollars a box
Sarah|0|
Ross|6|  And what is second prize
Ross|6|
Sarah|0| A ten speed bike
Sarah|0| But, I’d rather have something my Dad couldn’t sell
Sarah|0|
Ross|6| Well, that makes sense
Ross|6|
Sarah|0| Could you do me one favor, if it’s not too much trouble
Sarah|0|
Ross|6| Yeah, Sarah, anything
Ross|6|
Sarah|0| Could you pull open the curtains for me
Sarah|0| The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don’t have a TV, the lady across the alley said she’d push hers up to a window, so I could watch it
Sarah|0|
Woman|0|  Yesss
Woman|0|
Ross|6| Hi, I’m selling Brown Bird cookies
Ross|6|
Woman|0| You’re no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole
Woman|0|
Ross|6| No, hi, I’m, I’m an honorary Brown Bird 
Woman|0| What does that mean
Woman|0|
Ross|6| Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I’m not invited to sleep-overs
Ross|6|
Woman|0| I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know
Woman|0| Now, go away
Woman|0|
Ross|6| No, please, please, um, it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world
Ross|6|
Woman|0| I’m pressing, a policeman is on his way
Woman|0|
Ross|6| Okay, okay
Ross|6| I’m going
Ross|6| I’m going
Ross|6| 
Woman|0| I can still see you

Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Oh, that’s, that’s ah, one of the old ones, he’s just taking it to the back
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Well we have to make room for the fresh ones
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| So, what happens to the old guys
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Well, they go into the chipper

Monica|2| I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds
Monica|2|  Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all
Ross|6| But ah, y'know I’m sure that’s not gonna happen this time, why don’t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph’s
Ross|6|
Monica|2| No
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Oh, come on, now you know you want ‘em
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t do this

Joey|3| You need the fear
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| The fear
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| He’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Well then how come you’re still at a job that you hate, I mean why don’t you quit and get ‘the fear’
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Because, I’m too afraid
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| I don’t know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| Oh, I just don’t want to be 30 and still work here
