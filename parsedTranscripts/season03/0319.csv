Kate|0|
Joey|3| Hey, I’ve done plays before
Joey|3| I’m a serious actor
Joey|3|
Kate|0| That info-mercial
Kate|0| For the milk carton spout thing
Kate|0| You’re-you’re-you’re the guy that doesn’t know how to pour milk
Kate|0|
Kate|0|
Joey|3| See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn’t
Joey|3| Now, see, that’s acting
Joey|3|
Kate|0| Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie
Kate|0|
Joey|3| Yeah, that was real
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Wow
Phoebe|5| I cannot believe Mark asked you out
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| I know
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| What, so what are you gonna tell him
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Huh
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now
Rachel|1|  Oh, but it was so strange
Rachel|1| I mean I’m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him, which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty
Rachel|1| Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Ross or something
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Wow
Phoebe|5| So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| I don’t have any issues with my Father
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Okay, so it’s probably just the Ross thing then
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| I hate this woman
Joey|3|
Joey|3| I hate her
Joey|3| She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks
Joey|3| Okay, and whenever I can’t do it, they’re all like-like laughing at me
Joey|3|

Monica|2| I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future
Monica|2| Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on
Monica|2| I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me

The Director|0| Yes
The Director|0|
Kate|0| Well, I don’t understand why Adrienne’s attracted to Victor
Kate|0|
The Director|0| Peel the onion
The Director|0| First of all, he’s good looking
The Director|0|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3|
Kate|0| I think my character’s gonna need a little bit more of reason than that
Kate|0|
Joey|3| Oh, hey, how about this one
Joey|3| Ah, it’s says so in the script
Joey|3| Y'know ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch
Joey|3|
Kate|0| It doesn’t say that in the script
Kate|0|
Joey|3| It does in mine
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| I can blow dry it
Chandler|4| I can put gel on it
Chandler|4| It doesn’t matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head
Chandler|4| It’s so annoying
Chandler|4| Does it bug you
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| You bug me
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Is there any chance you didn’t see that
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| Ross
Chandler|4| You gotta stop

Ross|6|
Chandler|4| You didn’t just break up
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Hey, it’s been like three weeks
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up
Chandler|4| I mean bullets have left guns slower
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Here they come, here they come
Ross|6| Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I’m gonna kill myself, I swear
Ross|6| I can’t, I can’t watch this

Ross|6|
Ross|6| The door’s closed
Ross|6| I, I can’t see anything but the door closed
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Okay, I have to do something
Ross|6| I mean, I have, I have to stop it
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Stop what
Chandler|4|

Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| She’s moving on
Chandler|4| Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else
Chandler|4| And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over
Chandler|4| Okay, man
Chandler|4| It’s over
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Yeah, okay
Ross|6| 
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4|
