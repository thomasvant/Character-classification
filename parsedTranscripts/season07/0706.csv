Monica| Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Rachel| Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope it’s you!
Phoebe| I hope it’s you.
Rachel| Me too!
Monica| First of all um, I love you both so much and you’re both so important to me…
Rachel| Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Monica| Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine…
Phoebe| Yes!!! Oh!!
Rachel| Hypothetically!
Phoebe| Still.
Monica| If Phoebe were my maid of honor…
Rachel| Uh-hmm.
Monica| Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
Rachel| Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea.
Phoebe| Yeah, I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Monica|  Well that’s the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!
Phoebe| Wh-why is that the best part?
Monica| Because then I don’t have to!
Rachel| Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that…
Monica| I’m really not deciding!
Rachel| Fine!
Monica| Yeah that’s right.
Phoebe| Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!
Chandler| Die Hard still great!
Joey| Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
Chandler| What’d you rent?
Joey| Die Hard 2.
Chandler|  Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Joey| Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
Ross| Joey, we just saw it!
Joey| And?
Ross| And it’ll be cool to see it again! Yeah!
Joey|
Ross|
Ross| Dude, you didn’t say Die Hard. Is everything okay?
Chandler| Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
Ross| Well, John McLane had plans!
Chandler| No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.
Joey| What are you talking about? Bitch.
Phoebe| Hey Rachel?
Rachel| Yeah?
Phoebe| Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?
Rachel| Really?!
Phoebe| Uh-hmm.
Rachel| Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I’m just—Wait a minute. If I’m your maid of honor that means you are Monica’s.
Phoebe| Oh! Well, if that’s what you want…
Rachel| Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica’s!
Phoebe| But why does it even matter?!
Rachel| Why does it matter so much to you?!
Phoebe| Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry!
Rachel| What-what if I marry Ross—Or Joey?
Phoebe|  You wouldn’t! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I’ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you’ve done it at least twice!
Rachel| Yeah but Phoebe…
Phoebe| And no, oh please, oh please let me finish.  Oh I guess that was it.
Rachel| Okay. Okay. It’s—since you’ve never done it before you can be Monica’s made of honor.
Phoebe| Oh, thank you so much!  Okay.
Rachel| I’m gonna marry someone good y’know.
Phoebe| Oh I know.
Rachel| Better than Chandler. 
Ross| What happened?!!
Joey| Well, I don’t know!!
Ross| We fell asleep! That is all.
Joey| Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I’d better go.
Ross| I think that would be best.
Joey| Yeah. All right, I’ll talk to you later.
Ross| Okay. But not about this!
Joey| No! Never! Never!  Bye.
Ross| No touch! No touch!
Monica| Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good luck.
Chandler| That’s sweet.
Monica| No, it’s more like a  good luck.
Chandler| So uh, what did this woman look like?
Monica| She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Chandler| Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
Monica| Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
Chandler| No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive…  Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
Monica| What are you doing?
Chandler| Well, let’s see…  Okay uh, is that her? 
Monica| Oh my God yes! Who is she?
Chandler| Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Monica| Did you break up with her?
Chandler|  No, we’re still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Monica| Why?
Chandler| Well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…
Monica| Fat?!
Chandler|" I did not say fat! I said, ""Fa-aa-aw-ow…"""
Monica| You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!
Chandler| Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
Monica| Well, apparently she does.
Chandler| Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget.  Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Joey| Hey! What’s going on?
Rachel| Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor!
Joey| Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? 
Rachel| You have been maid of honor before?!!
Phoebe| See? This is exactly why you shouldn’t lie!
Rachel| All right that’s it! I am maid of honor!
Phoebe| Na-uh, I am!
Rachel| How come you are?!
Phoebe| Because I cared enough to lie!
Joey| Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type situations.
Phoebe| What are you talking about?
Joey| Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best of the people they see, they give me the part.
Phoebe| Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Joey| Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.
Phoebe|  Well, it’s better than us deciding.
Rachel| Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?!
Phoebe| No! Coins hate me!
Rachel| Okay. Okay fine, y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.   Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
Phoebe| Hey there, you handsome thing. 
Ross| Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio. 
Joey| Hi.
Ross| Just uh, brought back your videos.
Joey| Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.
Ross| No! No we don’t!
Joey| Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!! 
Ross| I… I don’t know what you are talking about.
Joey| Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!
Ross| I’ve had better.
Joey| Okay! When?!
Ross| All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Joey| Uh-huh!
Ross| I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!
Joey| I want to do it again.
Ross| We can’t do it again.
Joey| Why not?
Ross| Because it’s weird!
Joey| Fine! Do you want something to drink?
Ross| Sure, what do you got?
Joey| Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. 
Monica| Chandler!  Chandler! I just figured out who you are!
Chandler| Can you figure out what I’m doing?
Monica| You’re Lewis Posin.
Chandler| Who?
Monica| Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?
Chandler| Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
Monica| No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa….  And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.
Chandler| What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
Monica| No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.
Chandler| Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
Joey| Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.
Ross| No, 10 is the highest.
Joey| Why is 10 the highest?
Ross| Because it’s the highest.  Okay, Rachel you’re up first.  Situation No. 1: You’re with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! 
Joey|  I don’t want to marry Chandler!
Rachel| Okay, uh…
Joey| I’ve got cold feet.
Rachel| …it’s gonna be okay!
Joey| No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it! This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey!
Rachel| Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.
Joey|  Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!
Rachel| Thanks!
Ross| Yes, very nice Rachel.
Rachel| Thank you judges.
Phoebe| Ugh, what a kiss ass.
Rachel| Oh!
Joey| Okay, Phoebe…
Phoebe| Yes! Your honor?
Joey|" We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, ""I do"" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!"
Ross|  When Monica was a little girl, I remember that——Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Phoebe| Oh!
Joey| Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!
Rachel| Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Phoebe| Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!
Ross| It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.
Rachel| Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre…
Ross| Go!
Rachel| Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage as…  Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh… I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Ross|
Joey|
Rachel| Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve known them separately and I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass  to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Joey| Wow.  Good speech.
Ross| Yeah, it really was!
Rachel| Aw, thanks!
Ross| Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next  although I really don’t see the point.
Joey| Yeah.
Phoebe| Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked. 
Joey| And she’s back in the game.
Chandler|  Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.
Julie| Hello Skidmark.
Chandler|  It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later.
Monica| It’s pretty clear.
Chandler| Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.
Julie| That’s why you broke up with me?
Chandler| You-you-you didn’t know that.  Well, I guess my work here is done!
Joey| All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!
Phoebe| Really?! I won!
Rachel| What?!
Ross| I’m sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.
Rachel| Well then I demand a recount! 
Ross| Actually, it wasn’t that close.
Rachel| No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous—We’re gonna flip a coin!  All right?!  Heads! 
Phoebe| The coins have finally forgiven me!
Rachel| Well y’know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! 
Phoebe|  Rach, it’s gonna be okay!  You guys are the best!
Joey| Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.
Ross| Yeah?
Joey| Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.  
Ross| Why-why would I care about that?
Joey| No reason, I’m just saying that uh… That’s where I’ll be. 
Chandler| As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
Monica| Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.
Chandler| I would really love it if could do both.
Monica| All right, I…I have to ask.
Chandler| What?
Monica| Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
Chandler| What?!
Monica| Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
Chandler| A hundred and forty-five pounds.
Monica| In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s not the point.
Chandler| Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!
Monica| Well… That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Chandler| Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.
Monica| How?
Chandler| You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
Monica| What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different. I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are!
Chandler| Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.  See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica. 
Monica| Keep going.
Chandler| So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
Monica| Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
Chandler| I’d carry you around in my pocket.
Monica| I love you. 
Chandler| Skidmark’s still got a way with the ladies.
Rachel| Hi Pheebs.
Phoebe| Hi!
Rachel| Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby.
Phoebe| That’s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once.  Oh, you mean today.
Rachel| Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be yours.
Phoebe| Oh yeah!
Rachel| Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y’know just in case…
Phoebe| Oh that’s so sweet thanks.
Rachel| Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride.  And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and here’s a little purse that I found.  Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Phoebe| Ohh.
Rachel| And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause, people cry at weddings.  I’m just gonna grab a couple of these.
Phoebe| This stuff is great!
Rachel| Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s blue.  Yeah…
Phoebe| Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s made of honor.
Rachel| You do? Why?
Phoebe| Because I think it means more to you.
Rachel| But Pheebs, y’know you earned it.
Phoebe| Its fine. I mean, this is something that you’ve been thinking about since you were what, 14? 
Rachel| No, I was ten. I just developed early.
Phoebe|  Man alive!
Monica|  Hey, what’s going on?
Rachel| Hey!
Phoebe| Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
Monica|  Ohh, wow! That’s great!  Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; we’ll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? I’m so excited! 
Rachel| Yeah okay, you laugh now, but she’s gonna be yours. 
Joey| Great nap.
Ross| It really was.
Joey|  Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God! 
Ross|  Excuse me.
