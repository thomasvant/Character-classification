Chandler|4|  Hi
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3| Monica
Joey|3| What time is it
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Uhh, 9
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3| But it's dark out
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly
Monica|2| This is what 9 looks like
Monica|2|
Joey|3| I guess I'll get washed up then
Joey|3| Watch that sunrise
Joey|3| 
Monica|2| I'm really getting tired of sneaking around
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| I know, me too
Chandler|4| Hey
Chandler|4| Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend
Chandler|4| Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| All weekend
Monica|2| That's a whole lotta naked
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Okay, y'know your not though
Chandler|4| Let's go
Chandler|4| 
Monica|2| Wait
Monica|2| What about Joey
Monica|2|
Monica|2|  Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend
Monica|2| I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| I'm not in charge of where the conference is held
Chandler|4| Do you want people to think it's a fake conference
Chandler|4| It's a real conference
Chandler|4|
Ross|6|  Hey
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Hey
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Is Rachel here
Ross|6| I gotta talk to her
Ross|6|
Monica|2| No, she's out shopping
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Damn
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| What's going on
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| I told Emily to come
Ross|6| And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Wait a minute
Phoebe|5| So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6|" Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the ""I get to see my wife,"" part, all right"
Ross|6| And not the part that makes me do this
Ross|6| 
Monica|2| Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together
Monica|2| How is that even gonna work
Monica|2|
Ross|6| I have no idea
Ross|6| I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Doesn’t seem like it's going to work, I mean…
Rachel|1|  Hi, guys
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Hi
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Uh, hey
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| What's going on
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| We're flipping Monica's mattress
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Yeah that's better than my way
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Aww, man
Chandler|4| 
Rachel|1|  Oh look
Rachel|1| A letter from my mom
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Oh yeah
Rachel|1| I know
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5|  Can you hear anything
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4|" Oh yes, somebody just said, ""Can you hear anything"
Chandler|4|""""
Monica|2| Hey, Joey's ass
Monica|2| What are you doing
Monica|2|
Joey|3|  Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything
Joey|3| Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles…
Phoebe|5| Ooh, Madlibs, mine
Phoebe|5| 
Chandler|4| Condoms
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| You don't know how long we're gonna be in here
Joey|3| We may have to repopulate the Earth
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| And condoms are the way to do that
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily…
Rachel|1|  Oh my God
Rachel|1| My dog died
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| What
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Le Poo's still alive
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks
Rachel|1| Oh
Rachel|1|  Oh my God
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Sweetie, we heard you crying
Monica|2| Please don't cry
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| It's Le Poo
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4|  I can't believe it
Chandler|4| We're here
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Ooh, chocolates on the pillows
Monica|2| I love that
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Come here
Monica|2|  Okay, be right back
Monica|2| 
Chandler|4| Oh yes
Chandler|4| Monica, get in here
Chandler|4| There's a high-speed car chase on
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| We're switching rooms
Monica|2|
Chandler|4|  Oh dear God, they gave us glasses
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them
Monica|2| I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change
Monica|2|  Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed
Chandler|4| 
Ross|6| Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Oh yeah
Rachel|1| 
Ross|6| Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily
Ross|6| Well, there's this one thing… Okay,  here goes
Ross|6| I made a promise that--Oh hey
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| You're nose is bleeding
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Oh God
Rachel|1|  No
Rachel|1| Oh not again
Rachel|1|  This-this happened when my grandfather died
Rachel|1| It's ugh
Rachel|1| Sorry
Rachel|1|  Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Umm… 
Rachel|1| Sorry
Rachel|1| Sorry
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Yeah, I know
Rachel|1| It's ridiculous
Rachel|1| I can't see you either
Rachel|1|
Hotel Clerk|0| I think you'll find this room more to your liking
Hotel Clerk|0|
Chandler|4| Okay, great
Chandler|4| 
Hotel Clerk|0|  They say he's only got half a tank left
Hotel Clerk|0|
Chandler|4| Half a tank
Chandler|4| We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| We're switching rooms again
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| What
Chandler|4| Why
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room
Monica|2|
Hotel Clerk|0| Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you
Hotel Clerk|0|
Monica|2|  Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Uh-huh
Chandler|4| 
Monica|2| Chandler
Monica|2|
Chandler|4|  Yeah
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em
Monica|2| And we're not a couple of suckers
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| I hear ya, Mugsy
Chandler|4| But look, all these rooms are fine okay
Chandler|4| Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Okay, this one I like
Monica|2|
Chandler|4|  Nothing
Chandler|4| It's over
Chandler|4| Dammit
Chandler|4| This is regularly scheduled programming
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Can we turn the TV off
Monica|2| Okay
Monica|2| Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Oh, who should I blame
Chandler|4| The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Do not speak ill of the dead
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| I just want to watch a little television
Chandler|4| What is the big deal
Chandler|4| Geez, relax mom
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| What did you say
Monica|2|
Chandler|4|" I said, ""Geez, relax Monnnnn"
Chandler|4|""""
Rachel|1| Hi
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Hey
Ross|6| Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Okay, what's up
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants… 
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| …is for me not to see you anymore
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| That's crazy
Rachel|1| You can't do that
Rachel|1| What are you going to tell her
Rachel|1|   Oh God
Rachel|1| Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work
Ross|6| And I do, I have to make this marriage work
Ross|6| I have too
Ross|6| But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Ohh
Rachel|1| Lucky me
Rachel|1| Oh my God
Rachel|1| That is good news, Ross
Rachel|1| I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| You have no idea what a nightmare this has been
Ross|6| This is so hard
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Oh yeah, really
Rachel|1| Is it Ross
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1| Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| What are you doing
Ross|6|

Joey|3|
Chandler|4| It was terrible
Chandler|4| I fought with  my colleagues y'know, the entire time
Chandler|4| Are you kidding with this
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3| Oh, so your weekend was a total bust
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator
Chandler|4|
Monica|2|  Hi
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Hey, you're back too
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Yeah
Monica|2| Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Hey, how was your chef thing
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Oh, it was awful
Monica|2|  I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Chandler
Monica|2| 
Chandler|4| Monica
Chandler|4| 
Monica|2| Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Okay, fine, $300
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| 300 dollars
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Urghh
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Joey|3|  What are you guys woofing about
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Chandler stole a twenty from my purse
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Nooooo
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Joey|3| Y'know what
Joey|3| Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots
Joey|3|
Ross|6| You should've seen the look on her face
Ross|6| I don't want Rachel to hate me
Ross|6| I don't know what to do
Ross|6|
Joey|3| You want my advice
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Yes
Ross|6| Please
Ross|6|
Joey|3| You're not gonna like it
Joey|3|
Ross|6| That's okay
Ross|6|
Joey|3| You got married to fast
Joey|3|
Ross|6| That's not advice
Ross|6|
Joey|3| I told ya
Joey|3|
Ross|6| I'm going to the bathroom
Ross|6| 
Joey|3| Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it
Joey|3|

Phoebe|5| Hey
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Hey

Rachel|1| Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it
Rachel|1| All right
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there
Joey|3| 
Rachel|1| That's not Ross
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Oh no
Phoebe|5| Not that guy
Phoebe|5| He does look like him though
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Okay, Ross is in the bathroom
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Oh my God, its happening
Rachel|1| It's already started
Rachel|1| I'm Kip
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Hey, you're not Kip
Joey|3|
Rachel|1|  Do you even know who Kip is
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Who cares
Joey|3| You're Rachel
Joey|3|  Who's Kip
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Oh, that poor bastard
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| See
Rachel|1| Yeah, you told me the story
Rachel|1| He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened
Rachel|1| He got phased out
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| You're not gonna be phased out
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Well, of course I am
Rachel|1| It's not gonna happen to Ross
Rachel|1| He's your brother
Rachel|1|  He's your old college roommate
Rachel|1| Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group
Rachel|1| I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Ehh
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Honey, come on

Joey|3| That uh, hotel you stayed at called
Joey|3| Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yes that was mine
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yes that would have made more sense
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man
Joey|3| All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time
Joey|3| And whatever you say, I'll believe ya

Rachel|1| Isn't this against the rules
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice
Ross|6| I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Oh, Ross…
Ross|6| No, no, it's okay
Ross|6| Really
Ross|6| They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King
Ross|6| So is, is that better
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| No, it's not better
Rachel|1| I still don't get to see you
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Well, what-what would you do
Ross|6| Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| I can't believe this is happening
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| I know
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| I am so sorry
Ross|6|

Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Chandler that's crazy
Monica|2| If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh

Joey|3|
Chandler|4| It happened in London
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| IN LONDON
Joey|3|
Joey|3|

Joey|3| Aww, I don't want to see that
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| We're so stupid
Phoebe|5| Do you know what's going on in there
Phoebe|5| They're trying to take Joey
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe
Phoebe|5|" And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, ""Hi, Phoebe"
Phoebe|5|""""
Monica|2| Oh that's cute
Monica|2| We really all enjoyed it
Monica|2| But y'know, it doesn't count
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Count for what
Phoebe|5|

Joey|3| I guess I'm done
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Fun's over
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Wait-wait, guys
Monica|2| If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something
