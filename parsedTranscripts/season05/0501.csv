Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Oh yeah
Rachel|1| Of course, I mean, she’s gonna get over this, y’know
Rachel|1| I mean, so you said my name
Rachel|1|" Y’know you just said it ‘cause you saw me there, if you’d have seen a circus freak, you would’ve said, ""I take thee circus freak"
Rachel|1|""" Y’know, it didn’t mean anything, it’s just a mistake"
Rachel|1| It didn’t mean anything
Rachel|1| Right
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| No
Ross|6| No
Ross|6| Of course it didn’t mean anything
Ross|6| I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y’know, because-because it was you…
Rachel|1| Right…
Ross|6| But it absolutely didn’t
Ross|6|  It didn’t
Ross|6|
Ross|6| It didn’t
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Joey|3|  Ross, hey, the band’s ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so…

Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Joey|3| You spit on me man
Joey|3| 
Ross|6| Look, I’m sorry
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh
Joey|3|
Rachel|1|  Y’know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Oh, right
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Get the hell out of there, y’know
Rachel|1|
Ross|6|  Emily
Ross|6| Emily

Ross|6| 
Rachel|1| Well, look at that, same thing
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4|" Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, ""Yippee"
Chandler|4|""" just ignore me"
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Oh my God, Rachel
Monica|2| Hi
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Oh, hello Rachel
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Ross said my name
Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1| My name
Rachel|1| Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me
Rachel|1|  Okay, don’t believe me, I know I’m right—do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Yes, we do
Chandler|4| But, we have to change first

Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Hi, so what happened
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Well, Ross said my name
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, I know, but I don’t think that means anything
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Okay, Pheebs, y’know what, let’s look at this objectively all right
Rachel|1| Ninth grade, right
Rachel|1| The obsession starts
Rachel|1| All right
Rachel|1| The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow
Rachel|1| So then…
Chandler|4|  Hey, listen, why don’t we go change in my room
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| But my clothes are—ohh
Monica|2| 
Chandler|4| Wow, you look…
Monica|2| No time for that
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Hey, dude, let me in
Joey|3| I got a girl out here
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Well, I’ve got a girl in here
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| No you don’t, I just saw you go in there with Monica
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Well, we’re-we’re hanging out in here
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Well, I suppose I’d have to say you
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| But, what if we’re watching a movie in here
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Which we are, and-and we already paid for it
Monica|2| It’s My Giant
Monica|2|
Joey|3| My Giant
Joey|3| I love that movie
Joey|3|
Monica|2| You really think this is okay
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Well, Ross and Emily aren’t gonna use it
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Oh, it’s so beautiful
Monica|2| Ohh
Monica|2| Y’know, I-I don’t know if I feel right about this
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite
Chandler|4| The room expects sex
Chandler|4| The room would be disappointed if it didn’t get sex
Chandler|4| All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Okay
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4|
Ross|6|  Emily
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Nope, not under here
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| You didn’t find her
Monica|2|
Ross|6| No, I’ve looked everywhere
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Well, you couldn’t have looked everywhere or else you would’ve found her
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Yeah, I think you should keep looking
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah, for about 30 minutes
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Or 45
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice
Chandler|4| 
Ross|6| No
Ross|6| For all I know, she’s trying to find me but couldn’t because I kept moving around
Ross|6| No, from now on, I’m staying in one place
Ross|6|  Right here
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Well, it’s getting late
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah, we’re gonna go

Ross|6| Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Ugh, y’know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York

Ross|6|  That’s cool
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| But, we’ll stay here with you
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Thanks guys
Ross|6|  I really appreciate this, y’know, but you don’t have to rub my butt
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| We have to leave for New York in an hour
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| I know, I’ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don’t you think
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| We can’t do that that’s insane
Chandler|4| I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it
Chandler|4|

Ross|6| Oh yeah, I said Rachel’s name, but it didn’t mean anything, Okay
Ross|6| She’s-she’s just a friend and that’s all
Ross|6|  That’s all
Ross|6| Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can’t imagine spending my life with anyone else
Ross|6| Please, promise me that you’ll tell her that
Ross|6|
Mr. Waltham|0| All right, I’ll tell her
Mr. Waltham|0|  Come on bugger face
Mr. Waltham|0|
Mrs. Waltham|0|  Call me
Mrs. Waltham|0|
Mr. Waltham|0| You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don’t you ever go out the bloody window
Mr. Waltham|0|
Monica|2| Y’know, maybe it’s best that we never got to do it again
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special
Chandler|4|  Y’know, technically we still are over international waters
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| ‘Kay
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Can I ask you something
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Uhh, no
Chandler|4|
Joey|3|" Felicity and I, we’re watching My Giant, and I was thinking, ""I’m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant"
Joey|3|""" Do you think I’m just wasting my life with this acting thing"
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| No
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think I’ll ever get there
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yes
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Thanks man
Joey|3| 
Chandler|4| Okay man
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3| But what about how much taller he is than me
Joey|3|
Joey|3| I mean, there’s no way I can make myself taller now, y’know
Joey|3| And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man
Joey|3|
Joey|3| Hey, Monica, wow you’ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour
Joey|3|
Monica|2| I know

Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| All right, I’m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Oh, me too
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Why would you need to say hi to them, you’ve been feeding them for four days
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home
Phoebe|5| 
Monica|2| Well, we certainly are alone
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yes
Chandler|4| Good thing we have that, ‘Not in New York’ rule
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Right

Chandler|4| Right
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Well, an-anyway, I just—that night meant a lot to me, I guess I’m just trying to say thanks
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Oh
Chandler|4| Y’know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn’t because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me ‘cause, you’re really hot
Chandler|4| Is that okay
