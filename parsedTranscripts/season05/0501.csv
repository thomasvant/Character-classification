Mrs. Geller|Other|  This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Emily|Other| Just keep smiling.
Ross|Ross| Okay.
Joey|Joey| Well, that went well. Yeah.
Chandler|Chandler| It could’ve been worse, he could’ve shot her.
Ross|Ross|  That uh, that was pretty funny. Wasn’t it?
Emily|Other|  You’ve spoiled everything! It’s like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!
Joey|Joey|  Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
Ross|Ross|  That-that-that’s all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie. I’ll be right out here.  She’s just fixing her makeup.
Emily|Other| I hate you!!
Ross|Ross| And, I love you!! 
Mr. Geller|Other| Boy, bad time to say the wrong name, huh Ross?
Ross|Ross| That’s true, thanks dad.  People should be dancing! Huh? Hey, this is a party! Come on! Joey, dance!! 
Mrs. Waltham|Other| Yes, Waltham interiors.
Phoebe|Phoebe|  Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller’s personal physician, Dr. Philange.
Mrs. Waltham|Other| Who?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah, I’ve discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women’s names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
Mrs. Waltham|Other| Oh my God, Phoebe.
Phoebe|Phoebe| No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Hello?
Chandler|Chandler| Hey.
Monica|Monica| Hey.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh wow, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I’m just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
Monica|Monica| I know. How could we have let this happen?
Chandler|Chandler| Seven times!
Monica|Monica| Ugh! Well, y’know, we were away…
Chandler|Chandler| In a foreign, romantic country…
Monica|Monica| I blame London.
Chandler|Chandler| Bad London! 
Monica|Monica| So look umm, while we’re st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
Chandler|Chandler| Well, I don’t see that we have a choice. But, when we’re back home, we don’t do it.
Monica|Monica| Only here.
Chandler|Chandler| Y’know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs…
Monica|Monica| I’ll meet you there in two minutes.
Chandler|Chandler| Okay! 
Rachel|Rachel| Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
Monica|Monica|  Now?
Rachel|Rachel| Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can’t pretend that didn’t happen can I?
Monica|Monica| Oh, I-I don’t know.
Rachel|Rachel| Monica, what should I do?
Monica|Monica| Just uh, do the right thing. 
Rachel|Rachel| What?
Monica|Monica| Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box! 
Rachel|Rachel| Whoa, wait, listen, I think I’m just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
Monica|Monica| Wait. Rachel, no, he’s married. Married! If you don’t realize that, I can’t help you.
Rachel|Rachel| Okay, you’re right. You’re right. You can’t help me.
Mrs. Geller|Other| Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
Mr. Waltham|Other|  Yes.
Mr. Geller|Other| Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there’s no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
Joey|Joey| Hey, what’s up? 
Monica|Monica| Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
Chandler|Chandler| Forget it, that’s off.
Monica|Monica| Why?!
Mr. Waltham|Other|  The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes…
Monica|Monica| Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn’t eat meat until she has the babies!
Joey|Joey| Well, I figured we’re in another country, so it doesn’t count.
Monica|Monica| That’s true.
Chandler|Chandler| The man’s got a point.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, hi!
Ross|Ross| Hi!
Rachel|Rachel| Hi. Sorry, things aren’t working out so well.
Ross|Ross| Oh no! It could be better, but it’s gonna be okay, right?
Rachel|Rachel|" Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she’s gonna get over this, y’know? I mean, so you said my name! Y’know you just said it ‘cause you saw me there, if you’d have seen a circus freak, you would’ve said, ""I take thee circus freak."" Y’know, it didn’t mean anything, it’s just a mistake. It didn’t mean anything. Right?"
Ross|Ross| No! No! Of course it didn’t mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y’know, because-because it was you…
Rachel|Rachel| Right…
Ross|Ross| But it absolutely didn’t.  It didn’t!! It didn’t!!
Joey|Joey|  Ross, hey, the band’s ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so…
Ross|Ross|  Oh! Oh-oh, the band’s ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says—I don’t care about the stupid band!!
Joey|Joey| You spit on me man! 
Ross|Ross| Look, I’m sorry.
Joey|Joey| Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
Rachel|Rachel|  Y’know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Ross|Ross| Oh, right!
Rachel|Rachel| Get the hell out of there, y’know?
Ross|Ross|  Emily? Emily? I’m coming in. 
Rachel|Rachel| Well, look at that, same thing.
Chandler|Chandler|" Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, ""Yippee!"" just ignore me."
Monica|Monica| Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Chandler|Chandler| Oh, hello Rachel.
Rachel|Rachel| Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!  Okay, don’t believe me, I know I’m right—do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Chandler|Chandler| Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
Monica|Monica| Yes, I want to change. And why-why don’t you go down and get us a table?
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, we’ll be down in like five minutes.
Monica|Monica|  Fifteen minutes.
Rachel|Rachel| Okay.
Rachel|Rachel| Hello? Oh, Pheebs!  It’s Phoebe!
Chandler|Chandler| Oh, yay…
Monica|Monica| Great…
Rachel|Rachel| Hi!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Hi, so what happened?
Rachel|Rachel| Well, Ross said my name.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah, I know, but I don’t think that means anything.
Rachel|Rachel| Okay, Pheebs, y’know what, let’s look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then…
Chandler|Chandler|  Hey, listen, why don’t we go change in my room?
Monica|Monica| But my clothes are—ohh! 
Chandler|Chandler| Wow, you look…
Monica|Monica| No time for that!
Joey|Joey| Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Chandler|Chandler| Well, I’ve got a girl in here.
Joey|Joey| No you don’t, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Chandler|Chandler| Well, we’re-we’re hanging out in here!
Joey|Joey| Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Chandler|Chandler| Well, I suppose I’d have to say you!! But, what if we’re watching a movie in here?
Monica|Monica| Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It’s My Giant!
Joey|Joey| My Giant? I love that movie!
Monica|Monica| You really think this is okay?
Chandler|Chandler| Well, Ross and Emily aren’t gonna use it.
Monica|Monica| Oh, it’s so beautiful. Ohh! Y’know, I-I don’t know if I feel right about this.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn’t get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Monica|Monica| Okay!
Chandler|Chandler| Okay!
Ross|Ross|  Emily?!
Chandler|Chandler| Nope, not under here!
Monica|Monica| You didn’t find her?
Ross|Ross| No, I’ve looked everywhere!
Chandler|Chandler| Well, you couldn’t have looked everywhere or else you would’ve found her!
Monica|Monica| Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Monica|Monica| Or 45.
Chandler|Chandler| Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice. 
Ross|Ross| No! For all I know, she’s trying to find me but couldn’t because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I’m staying in one place.  Right here.
Monica|Monica| Well, it’s getting late.
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, we’re gonna go.
Ross|Ross| Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Monica|Monica| Ugh, y’know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, it’s a very large plane.
Ross|Ross|  That’s cool.
Chandler|Chandler| But, we’ll stay here with you.
Ross|Ross| Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, y’know, but you don’t have to rub my butt.
Chandler|Chandler| We have to leave for New York in an hour.
Monica|Monica| I know, I’ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don’t you think?
Chandler|Chandler| We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.
Ross|Ross| Em-Emily?  Em-Emily?  Emily! 
Mr. Waltham|Other| No.
Mrs. Waltham|Other| You can forget about Emily, she’s not with us.
Mr. Waltham|Other| We’ve come for her things.
Ross|Ross| Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
Mr. Waltham|Other| She’s in hiding. She’s utterly humiliated. She doesn’t want to see you ever again.
Mrs. Waltham|Other| We’re very sad that it didn’t work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you’re absolutely delicious.
Mr. Waltham|Other| Excuse me, I’m standing right here!
Mrs. Waltham|Other| Oh yes, there you are.
Rachel|Rachel|  Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there’s a whole cart outside… 
Mr. Waltham|Other| Goodbye Geller.
Ross|Ross| Now, hold on! Hold on!  Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I’m gonna be at that airport and I hope that she’ll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel’s name, but it didn’t mean anything, Okay? She’s-she’s just a friend and that’s all!  That’s all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can’t imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you’ll tell her that.
Mr. Waltham|Other| All right, I’ll tell her.  Come on bugger face!
Mrs. Waltham|Other|  Call me.
Mr. Waltham|Other| You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don’t you ever go out the bloody window!
Monica|Monica| Y’know, maybe it’s best that we never got to do it again.
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Y’know, technically we still are over international waters.
Monica|Monica| I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?
Chandler|Chandler| ‘Kay!
Joey|Joey| Can I ask you something?
Chandler|Chandler| Uhh, no.
Joey|Joey|" Felicity and I, we’re watching My Giant, and I was thinking, ""I’m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant."" Do you think I’m just wasting my life with this acting thing?"
Chandler|Chandler| No.
Joey|Joey| I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think I’ll ever get there?
Chandler|Chandler| Yes.
Joey|Joey| Thanks man. 
Chandler|Chandler| Okay man. 
Joey|Joey| But what about how much taller he is than me?
Joey|Joey| I mean, there’s no way I can make myself taller now, y’know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
Joey|Joey| Hey, Monica, wow you’ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
Monica|Monica| I know!
Joey|Joey| Had the beef-tips, huh?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Hey!
Chandler|Chandler| Hey!
Joey|Joey| Hi!
Phoebe|Phoebe|  You ate meat!   You had sex! 
Chandler|Chandler| No we didn’t!
Phoebe|Phoebe| I know you didn’t, I was talking about Monica.
Monica|Monica| Phoebe, I did not have sex.
Phoebe|Phoebe| This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
Joey|Joey| All right, I’m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, me too!
Joey|Joey| Why would you need to say hi to them, you’ve been feeding them for four days?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home. 
Monica|Monica| Well, we certainly are alone.
Chandler|Chandler| Yes! Good thing we have that, ‘Not in New York’ rule.
Monica|Monica| Right. Umm, listen since we’re-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross’s mother…
Chandler|Chandler| Right.
Monica|Monica| Well, an-anyway, I just—that night meant a lot to me, I guess I’m just trying to say thanks.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh. Y’know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn’t because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me ‘cause, you’re really hot! Is that okay?
Monica|Monica|  That’s okay.
Chandler|Chandler| And I’m cute too.
Monica|Monica| And you’re cute too.
Chandler|Chandler| Thank you!  All right, I gotta go unpack.
Monica|Monica| Okay.
Chandler|Chandler| Bye. 
Chandler|Chandler|  I’m still on London time, does that count?
Monica|Monica| That counts!
Chandler|Chandler| Oh, good! 
Ross|Ross| Rach! Rach!
Rachel|Rachel|  Hi!
Ross|Ross| Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?
Rachel|Rachel| Well, I-I-I’ve been on Standby for a flight home for hours. 
Ross|Ross| Oh.
Rachel|Rachel| Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Ross|Ross| Not yet.
Rachel|Rachel| So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
Gate Agent|Other|  This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
Ross|Ross| Pretty soon I guess.
Rachel|Rachel| Yeah. I’m sorry.
Ross|Ross| I just, I don’t understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y’know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she’d actually show up?
Rachel|Rachel| No, you’re not an idiot, Ross. You’re a guy very much in love.
Ross|Ross| Same difference.
Gate Agent|Other|  All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
Ross|Ross| I get it! Well, that’s that.
Rachel|Rachel| No, you know what, I think you should go.
Ross|Ross| What?
Rachel|Rachel| Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it’d be really good.
Ross|Ross| Oh, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t know…
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
Ross|Ross| I could, yeah, I can do that.
Rachel|Rachel| Yeah.
Ross|Ross| I can’t, I can’t even believe her! No, y’know what, I am, I am gonna go!
Rachel|Rachel| Good!
Ross|Ross| I know, why not?
Rachel|Rachel| Right!
Ross|Ross| Right?
Rachel|Rachel| Right!
Ross|Ross| Y’know—thanks! 
Rachel|Rachel| Okay, I’ll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Ross|Ross| Yeah, well…nah.
Rachel|Rachel| What? Wait, what?
Ross|Ross| Why don’t you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
Rachel|Rachel| Well-well, I don’t know Ross—really?
Ross|Ross| Yeah, yeah, it’ll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
Rachel|Rachel| Uh-huh.
Ross|Ross| No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
Ross|Ross| Okay!
Rachel|Rachel| Okay!
Ross|Ross| Cool!
Rachel|Rachel| All right!
Ross|Ross| Come on!  Here. 
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, okay, we’re going. Yeah.
Ross|Ross| Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, wait-wait-wait…
Ross|Ross| You tell them to wait!
Rachel|Rachel| Okay. Wait! Wait!
Ross|Ross| Emily.
Ross|Ross| Oh no-no-no! Oh-no!  No! No! Emily!
Rachel|Rachel| Ahh, yes, I will have a glass of the Merlot and uh,  he will have a white wine spritzer. Woo!  Hey, look at that, the airport’s moving.  Hey, are we moving?! Are we moving? Why are we moving? Hey, time-out, umm, yeah, does the captain know that we’re moving?  Oh my God. Oh, my gosh.
