Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Hey
Chandler|4| 
Ross|6| Emily's cousin kicked me out
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| What
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3| Why
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| How can he do that
Chandler|4| Didn't you sign a lease
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Who needs a lease when it's family
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Hey, you can stay with us
Joey|3| We'll take care of ya
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Oh, yeah
Chandler|4| Absolutely
Chandler|4| Anything you need man
Chandler|4| But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3|
Ross|6| You got it
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Okay
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this
Ross|6| All right, I'm gonna get packing again
Ross|6| Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad
Ross|6|
Ross|6| What

Chandler|4| He thought you said gonad
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Oh, Larry
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Umm, do health inspectors work on commission
Phoebe|5| 
Larry|0| No, bribes
Larry|0|
Phoebe|5| It's okay to laugh right
Phoebe|5|
Larry|0| Yeah, I was just kidding
Larry|0|
Phoebe|5| Okay

Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Yum-my
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Larry
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Oh yeah
Phoebe|5| I'd let him check out my kitchen floors
Phoebe|5|
Larry|0|  A 98
Larry|0| I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation
Larry|0|
Monica|2| Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen
Monica|2|
Larry|0| And where is your hat
Larry|0|
Monica|2| It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it
Monica|2| 
Larry|0| Ahh that's the 2 points
Larry|0|
Phoebe|5| Hey, you should really read that book you wrote
Phoebe|5|  Wow
Phoebe|5| You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it
Phoebe|5| You can have your own health inspector detective show
Phoebe|5|
Larry|0| Oh, I don't know about that
Larry|0|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda
Phoebe|5|
Larry|0| Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime
Larry|0|
Phoebe|5| Okay, she would love that
Phoebe|5| Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat
Phoebe|5|
Larry|0| I-I'll call ya
Larry|0|
Phoebe|5| Okay

Monica|2|
Rachel|1|  Okay
Rachel|1| All right, I see what he's doing
Rachel|1| He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| And you're not gonna do that
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| That's right
Rachel|1| 'Cause that would give him the control
Rachel|1| So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation
Rachel|1| Blew up in his face, didn't it
Rachel|1|

Chandler|4|
Ross|6|  Oh yeah
Ross|6| You're—hey, you're right
Ross|6| Here's an affordable place,  two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| What about that circled one
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio

Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Let's go quicker
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah

Joey|3| Somebody was using his head
Joey|3| Hey, let's check out the rest of the place
Joey|3|
Ross|6| I think this is it
Ross|6| I don't know, maybe we should keep looking
Ross|6|
Joey|3| But hey, Ross, this place is available now
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3|
Ross|6|  So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Oh, it's perfect
Joey|3|
Ross|6|  How about you
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| It's a kitchen slash bathroom
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| All right, I see what you guys are saying
Ross|6| I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| We are bad people
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| He knew we were trying to get rid of him
Joey|3| He knew
Joey|3|  You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen
Joey|3|
Larry|0|  Hey, ready for dinner
Larry|0|
Phoebe|5| Ooh, absolutely
Phoebe|5|
Larry|0| Great
Larry|0| How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right

Phoebe|5|
Larry|0| How about Mama Lisettie's
Larry|0|
Phoebe|5| Enh
Phoebe|5| Sure
Phoebe|5|
Larry|0|  I wonder how long that milk  has been setting out
Larry|0|
Phoebe|5| Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy
Phoebe|5| That—this milk is mine
Phoebe|5| I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know
Phoebe|5|  Okay, let's go
Phoebe|5|
Larry|0| Hey, buddy
Larry|0|  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit
Larry|0|
Gunther|0| But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place
Gunther|0|
Larry|0| Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health
Larry|0|
Larry|0|
Phoebe|5| Okay, stop
Phoebe|5| Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy
Phoebe|5| Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever
Phoebe|5|
Larry|0| Well, I suppose I could give him a warning
Larry|0|
Phoebe|5| Thank you
Phoebe|5|  Okay, go
Phoebe|5| Go
Phoebe|5| Go
Phoebe|5|   Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yes that was a nice place
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| What are we gonna do
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| I don't know
Joey|3| Maybe pizza

Chandler|4| That uh, barks into the night
Chandler|4|  Well, who doesn't love dogs
Chandler|4|  Ah, he's a tap dancer
