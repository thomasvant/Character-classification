Monica|Monica| Well, it just seems that…

Chandler|Chandler| Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?
Phoebe|Phoebe|" Uh, it's a piece of paper and it says, ""Ross"" on it."
Joey|Joey|  Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle and guess what.  I GOT THE LEAD IN A MOVIE!!!!!!
Chandler|Chandler| You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
Joey|Joey|" It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears… But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, ""Where's Betsy?"" Right? And she says, ""Betsy's been dead for 10 years."""
Phoebe|Phoebe| Ohh-oh, chilling!
Joey|Joey| And the best part is, we're filming in the desert outside Vegas!  And you know what that means buddy!
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, I know that means buddy!
Joey|Joey| Road trip! Yeah, we can rent a car! I just have to be there by Tuesday!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh wait, my grandmother's dead.
Chandler|Chandler| Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs.
Phoebe|Phoebe| No! No, her cab! She probably won't be using it; you can drive it to Las Vegas.
Joey|Joey| All right! Thanks Pheebs!
Chandler|Chandler| Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?
Joey|Joey| Oh umm, not go.
Chandler|Chandler| All right, great, road trip baby!  This okay with you?

Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh hey Joey! What's up?
Joey|Joey| I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah, I've been around.
Joey|Joey| Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
Joey|Joey| Great! Problem solved!
Phoebe|Phoebe| But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Joey|Joey| Well, back to square one.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
Joey|Joey|  Yes!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind.  Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?
Joey|Joey| Peanut butter!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
Joey|Joey| A swimmer!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Joey|Joey| Monica. Oh… huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
Phoebe|Phoebe| No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?
Joey|Joey| Ascot!
Phoebe|Phoebe| North route or south route?
Joey|Joey| North route!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Bamn! There you go! Huh?
Joey|Joey| Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
Ross|Ross|  Hey!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, this guy again. 
Joey|Joey| Hey man, what's up?
Ross|Ross| Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
Joey|Joey| Sure, what do you want to see?
Ross|Ross| I don't know, umm…
Joey|Joey| Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Umm, no thank you. 
Ross|Ross| What's with her?
Joey|Joey| I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
Ross|Ross| Okay.
Joey|Joey| What do you like better action or comedy?
Ross|Ross| Action.
Joey|Joey| Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel? 
Ross|Ross| Dude, you are sick.
Joey|Joey| Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh my God! What does that thing do?
Monica|Monica|  Oh that's an eye removal machine.
Rachel|Rachel| All right, I'm outta here!
Monica|Monica| I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Rachel|Rachel| Hey!
Rachel|Rachel| So were done then!
Dr. Miller|Other| Almost! But first, we gotta start.
Rachel|Rachel| Okay.
Dr. Miller|Other| This is a glaucoma test.
Rachel|Rachel| Uh-huh.
Dr. Miller|Other| Sit down.
Rachel|Rachel| Okay.
Dr. Miller|Other| But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
Rachel|Rachel|  What?!
Monica|Monica| A small puff of air, now come on!
Dr. Miller|Other| Here we go.
Rachel|Rachel| All right.
Dr. Miller|Other| 1…2…3! 
Rachel|Rachel| I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time.  Okay.
Dr. Miller|Other| Ready?
Rachel|Rachel| Uh-huh.
Dr. Miller|Other| 1…2… 
Monica|Monica| Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Rachel|Rachel| Okay.
Dr. Miller|Other| That's okay.
Monica|Monica| Okay. 
Rachel|Rachel| Okay. Okay!
Dr. Miller|Other| 1…2!   Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
Rachel|Rachel|  Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy! 
Dr. Miller|Other| Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
Rachel|Rachel| Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Dr. Miller|Other| Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.
Rachel|Rachel| Great!
Dr. Miller|Other| And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
Rachel|Rachel| Okay, just give me the damn drops! 
Monica|Monica| Dr. Miller?  P E C F D.
Dr. Miller|Other| Very good Monica! You know where they are.
Monica|Monica| I sure do!   And you don't get one!
Rachel|Rachel| Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
Monica|Monica| They're still in my coat.
Rachel|Rachel| Damn!
Chandler|Chandler|  Hey!
Joey|Joey| Hey! You ready to go?
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough? 
Chandler|Chandler| What?
Monica|Monica| I love you.
Joey|Joey| Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Chandler|Chandler| Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Joey|Joey| Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Chandler|Chandler| I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Joey|Joey| Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
Chandler|Chandler| So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Joey|Joey|" Did you not hear the plot of the movie? ""She's been dead for ten years."" I'm gonna be a millionaire!"
Ross|Ross|  Hey!
Joey|Joey| Hey!
Ross|Ross| I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.
Joey|Joey| You got it!
Ross|Ross| All right!
Chandler|Chandler| All right, bye-bye now!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Bye!
Rachel|Rachel| Bye you guys!
Joey|Joey| Bye-bye!
Monica|Monica| I wanna say good-bye at the car!
Chandler|Chandler| Okay!
Joey|Joey| Anybody want to say good-bye to me at the car?
Rachel|Rachel| Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.
Joey|Joey| See ya! 
Rachel|Rachel| Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing! 
Ross|Ross| Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading?  Pheebs?  Hello?  Phoebe?  Phoe-Phoebe!  Come on! 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.
Ross|Ross| Phoebe, are you, are you mad at me, or something? 'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Well, if you don't know I can't help you.
Ross|Ross| Well, I don't know.

Ross|Ross| Well if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh no, I am mad at you. I know that much. But, I am sorry about the fat ass thing. You actually have a very sweet little hiney. 
Joey|Joey| Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
Chandler|Chandler| We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
Joey|Joey| Don't worry, it's out there!  I think I just need lunch.
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah.
Joey|Joey| You wanna eat?  My treat!
Chandler|Chandler| Isn't that Ross's money?
Joey|Joey| Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?
Chandler|Chandler| I don't know.
Joey|Joey| Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
Chandler|Chandler| Okay!
Joey|Joey| Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
Chandler|Chandler| Too dry.
Joey|Joey| Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?
Chandler|Chandler| No!
Joey|Joey| Is this movie gonna be my big break?
Chandler|Chandler| No!
Joey|Joey|  What?!
Chandler|Chandler| Yes.
Joey|Joey|" Dude you said, ""No!"""
Chandler|Chandler|" I also said, ""Yes!"""
Joey|Joey| You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?
Chandler|Chandler| No!  Ahhh!!!
Joey|Joey| I don't believe this!
Chandler|Chandler| Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
Joey|Joey| What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!
Chandler|Chandler| They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Joey|Joey| Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Chandler|Chandler| Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Joey|Joey| Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Joey|Joey| Not if you're gonna be like this!
Chandler|Chandler| All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Joey|Joey| Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
Chandler|Chandler| All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
Joey|Joey| Fine!  Get out!
Chandler|Chandler| You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Joey|Joey| Get out!!
Chandler|Chandler| All right!!  Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
Ross|Ross| Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
Phoebe|Phoebe| No.
Ross|Ross| Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
Phoebe|Phoebe| No that made me feel precious.
Monica|Monica| Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
Ross|Ross| Yeah? Sometimes it's… 
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
Ross|Ross| Okay, I'm the baby. 
Rachel|Rachel| Eh! Stop it!
Chandler|Chandler|  Hey!
Monica|Monica| Chandler! What are you doing here?
Ross|Ross| Hey!
Chandler|Chandler| Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
All|Other| Why?!
Chandler|Chandler| I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Phoebe|Phoebe| That game should not be played without my supervision. 
Chandler|Chandler| Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
Phoebe|Phoebe| What's in the bag?
Chandler|Chandler| Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road.  Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
Phoebe|Phoebe| I do!
Rachel|Rachel| Okay. 
Monica|Monica| Not even close.
Rachel|Rachel| Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!
Monica|Monica| Okay! All right! Let's do it!
Rachel|Rachel| All right!
Monica|Monica| Sit down. 
Rachel|Rachel| All right.
Monica|Monica| Put your head back.
Rachel|Rachel| Yes!
Monica|Monica| All right.
Rachel|Rachel| Okay.
Monica|Monica| Now, open your eyes.
Rachel|Rachel| Okay, they are. 
Monica|Monica| How many fingers am I holding up? 
Rachel|Rachel|  Four.
Monica|Monica| Oh my God, I was thinking four.
Rachel|Rachel| Really?!
Monica|Monica| Yes! All right, y'know what? Why don't we start with a practice run? Okay?
Rachel|Rachel| Okay!
Monica|Monica| No drops!
Rachel|Rachel| Great!
Monica|Monica| Okay.
Rachel|Rachel| Okay.
Monica|Monica| On three, 1…2…3!  Now my pillow's all wet! 
Rachel|Rachel| Well, well, you said it was practice!
Monica|Monica| Then why did you move?!
Rachel|Rachel| Because I knew you were lying!
Monica|Monica| All right, come here! 
Rachel|Rachel|  What are you? Monica!! Stop it!! Oh my God! Stop it! 
Monica|Monica| I am going… I'm going--Turn it over!  I'm… I am going to get these drops in your eyes.  
Rachel|Rachel| Oh my God! You really are freakishly strong!
Rachel|Rachel| Monica! Stop it!
Monica|Monica|  Damn! It's empty!
Rachel|Rachel| Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune! 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross.  Or-or Rachel!
Monica|Monica|  Hello?   It's Joey.   I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Joey|Joey|  Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
Monica|Monica| What did you do to his sweater vests?
Joey|Joey| Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Monica|Monica| Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second. 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Hey, dude!
Joey|Joey| Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh that's my grandma.  And thanks Joey she's having a really great time. 
Chandler|Chandler|  Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering…  Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Chandler|Chandler| Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Monica|Monica| Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Chandler|Chandler| That's a good idea. I wonder where I could  get a basket of porn…
Phoebe|Phoebe| No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
Chandler|Chandler| Really?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
Ross|Ross|  Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Uh-hmm.
Ross|Ross| What do you like better flora or fauna?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Fauna.
Ross|Ross| Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Garfunkle.
Ross|Ross| Why are you mad at me?
Phoebe|Phoebe| You said I was boring--Ohh!
Ross|Ross| When did I say you were boring?!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
Ross|Ross| Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!  Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
Joey|Joey| Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.
Stanley|Other| Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
Joey|Joey| Wh-what?! Why?!
Stanley|Other| It's a money thing, we don't have any.
Joey|Joey|  You're kidding right?
Stanley|Other| No.
Joey|Joey| What?!
Stanley|Other| It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
Joey|Joey| Uh, hang out?! How long?
Stanley|Other| I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
Joey|Joey| No!
