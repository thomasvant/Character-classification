Rachel|1| Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever
Rachel|1| I think you killed us
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| I couldn't possibly eat another bite
Ross|6| 
Joey|3| I need something sweet
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Does anyone wanna watch TV
Phoebe|5|
All|0| Yeah, sure
All|0|
Phoebe|5| Monica your remote doesn't work
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Phoebe, you have to lift it and point
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5| Aw, forget it
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Yeah, you know what we should all do
Rachel|1| We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Ooh-ooh, I
Joey|3| I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having
Joey|3|
Monica|2| That's very nice
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| That's sweet, Joey
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up
Joey|3| Oh
Joey|3| Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs
Joey|3| 
Joey|3| I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering
Joey|3| I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material
Joey|3| And the way they play with your mind
Joey|3| Is it there
Joey|3| Is it not there
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Are you aware that you're still talking
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Huh, I don't know what to pick
Ross|6| Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction
Ross|6| Hmm
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Wow
Phoebe|5| See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| I'm sorry
Ross|6| It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| No-no-no
Chandler|4| I am the king of bad Thanksgivings
Chandler|4| You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Oh God, no
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Oh, come on
Joey|3| I wanna hear it
Joey|3| It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| It's a tradition, like the parade
Chandler|4| If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family
Chandler|4|
Mrs. Bing|0| Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you
Mrs. Bing|0| It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me
Mrs. Bing|0|
The Housekeeper|0| More turkey Mr
The Housekeeper|0| Chandler
The Housekeeper|0| 
Ross|6| You're right
Ross|6| Yours is worse
Ross|6| You are the king of bad Thanksgivings
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| I don't know about that
Phoebe|5| I've got one that's worse
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Really
Chandler|4|" Worse than, ""More turkey Mr"
Chandler|4| Chandler
Chandler|4|""""
Phoebe|5| Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler
Phoebe|5| Yes, mine's worse
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| In this life, Phoebe
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Oh, this life
Phoebe|5| Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that
Joey|3| I don't have any past life memories
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Of course you don't sweetie
Phoebe|5| You're brand new
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving

Joey|3|
Monica|2| What-what are you doing
Monica|2| Is this supposed to be funny
Monica|2|

Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Well, get it off now
Monica|2|
Joey|3| I can't
Joey|3| It-it's stuck
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Well, I don't care

Joey|3|""" And it came out, ""Squatternut buash"
Joey|3|""""
Ross|6| Yeah that's the same
Ross|6|
Monica|2| That's it

Phoebe|5|
All|0| Which one
All|0|
Monica|2| Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story

Monica|2| Is there, is there something on my dress
Monica|2| 
Chandler|4| You just, you look so different
Chandler|4| Terrific
Chandler|4| That dress
Chandler|4| That body
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Dude
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Sorry

Chandler|4| Sorry
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1|  Oh-ho, my God
Rachel|1| That was so awesome
Rachel|1| You totally got him back for calling you fat
Rachel|1| He was just drooling all over you
Rachel|1| That must've felt so great
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Well it didn't
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great
Monica|2| Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore
Monica|2| Blah, blah, blah
Monica|2| Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know
Monica|2| I just want to humiliate him
Monica|2| I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Okay, that we may be able to do
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| How
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| What
Monica|2|
Monica|2| I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it
Rachel|1| Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him
Rachel|1| You're just gonna make him think that you are
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Yeah
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Then, you will definitely get him back
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Okay, oh, here's what you do
Rachel|1| Just act like everything around you turns you on
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| What do you mean
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Well, like anything can be sexy
Rachel|1| Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel
Rachel|1|  Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek
Rachel|1| And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it
Rachel|1| Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him
Rachel|1|
Monica|2|  I can do that
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1| Good, good, because he's coming
Rachel|1| He's coming
Rachel|1|  Hey, what's up
Rachel|1| 
Chandler|4| Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Umm, I'd love too
Monica|2|  Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese
Monica|2| I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Boy, I love carrots
Monica|2| Oh
Monica|2|  Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you
Monica|2|  Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife  and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm,  my body
Monica|2| 
Chandler|4| Are you all right
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Oh yeah, of course
Monica|2| I'm fine it's just that—
The Doctor|0| What do we got here

Mr. Geller|0| They're made of wicker
Mr. Geller|0|
The Doctor|0| Did you bring the toe
The Doctor|0|
Monica|2| Oh yes

The Doctor|0|  Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and—
Monica|2| What
Monica|2|
Monica|2| What is it
Monica|2|
The Doctor|0| You brought a carrot
The Doctor|0|

Rachel|1| You brought a carrot
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Mrs. Geller|0| Oh my God
Mrs. Geller|0| There's a toe in my kitchen
Mrs. Geller|0|
Monica|2| God, I'm sorry
Monica|2| I'll go back and get it
Monica|2|
The Doctor|0| It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound
The Doctor|0|
Chandler|4| Without my toe
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| I need my toe
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast
Monica|2| Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche
Monica|2|
Mr. Geller|0| Oh, I'm not falling for that one
Mr. Geller|0|
Chandler|4| That's why I lost my toe
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| Because I called you fat
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| I didn't mean to cut it off
Monica|2| It was an accident
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| I'm sorry
Monica|2| It wasn't your whole toe
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah, well, I miss the tip
Chandler|4| It's the best part
Chandler|4| It has the nail
Chandler|4| 
Monica|2| Chandler
Monica|2| 
Ross|6|  Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that
Ross|6|
Joey|3| You're a dork
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| I can't believe this
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Chandler, I said I was sorry
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah, well, sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home
Chandler|4| I hate this stupid day
Chandler|4| And everything about it
Chandler|4| I'll see you later
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do
Monica|2| Anything
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah, just leave me alone for a while
Chandler|4| 
Chandler|4| Oh-oh, I'm a duck
Chandler|4|" I go, ""Quack, quack"
Chandler|4|""" I’m happy all the time"
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| Nice try
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Wait, wait, wait
Monica|2| 
Chandler|4| Look, Monica…
