Joey|3|  Hey
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3|
Joey|3| None of that, not while you're living under my roof
Joey|3|
Monica|2| What
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman
Joey|3|  And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition
Joey|3| Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| 
Monica|2| 
Monica|2| Sorry
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Sorry
Chandler|4|
Joey|3|  I can hear that
Joey|3|
Monica|2|  Rachel's at work
Monica|2|
Joey|3| I can still hear you
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Hey
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Hey
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Hello
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Hey, what's that
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother
Phoebe|5| Can you believe it
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| Eeeee--ohh
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| God
Phoebe|5| 
Joey|3| Argh-argh
Joey|3|
Joey|3|  Ooh, soft
Joey|3| Is this mink
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5| Why would my mother send me a fur
Phoebe|5| Doesn't she know me but at all
Phoebe|5| Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour
Chandler|4|  That didn't happen, I made that up
Chandler|4|
Ross|6|  Hey
Ross|6|
Gunther|0| Oh, Ross
Gunther|0| Ross
Gunther|0| You can't put up flyers in here
Gunther|0|
Ross|6| How come
Ross|6| Everybody else does
Ross|6|
Gunther|0| You can't
Gunther|0|
Monica|2| What is that
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things
Ross|6|
Monica|2|  This is all of your things
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Yes, yes it is
Ross|6| No, but it's good it's—Emily thinks we should get all new stuff
Ross|6| Stuff that's just ours, together
Ross|6| Y'know brand new
Ross|6|
Monica|2| So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Touched
Ross|6| Used
Ross|6| Sat on
Ross|6| Sleep on
Ross|6|
Gunther|0| I'll take it all
Gunther|0|
Joey|3| Hey, Ross, you're okay with that
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| After what I did
Ross|6| Can you blame her
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Oh my God
Phoebe|5| You got off easy
Phoebe|5| When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3|  What is he doing
Joey|3| What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Now calm down Joey
Monica|2|
Joey|3| No
Joey|3| Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know
Joey|3| Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Oh, I hate this
Phoebe|5| Everything's changing
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence…
Monica|2| Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves
Monica|2| Are you cool with that
Monica|2|
Joey|3| No
Joey|3| But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Ohh, whoa God
Rachel|1| Storage rooms give me the creeps
Rachel|1| Monica, come on please hurry up honey
Rachel|1| Please
Rachel|1| 
Monica|2| Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| I want the little round waffles
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| All right
Monica|2|  Op, here it is
Monica|2| Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb
Monica|2| I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Okay, y'know what
Rachel|1| I'll-I'll have toast
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| Arghhhh
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Oh my God
Monica|2| Fog him
Monica|2| Fog him
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| I'll take it
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| That might work
Phoebe|5| 
Joey|3| Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Joey|3|  Enh
Joey|3| All right, what do you think
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| You're on in 5 Ms
Chandler|4| Minnelli
Chandler|4| 
Ross|6|  No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden
Ross|6|  No, it's great
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6| I'm totally on board
Ross|6| I love you too, all righty
Ross|6| Bye
Ross|6| 
Joey|3| What's the matter Ross
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Nothing
Ross|6| Oh, actually, great news
Ross|6| I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment
Ross|6| Woo-hoo
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Why
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment
Ross|6| Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other
Ross|6|
Joey|3| That's way uptown
Joey|3| That's like three trains away
Joey|3|  Which is great
Joey|3| I love to ride that rail
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| So you're really okay with this
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Yes
Ross|6| Yes
Ross|6| I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute
Ross|6| I-I've been given the gift of time
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space
Chandler|4| We should get them together and make a continuum
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Now he's movin'
Joey|3| Man, what is Emily doing to him
Joey|3|  Ow
Joey|3|
Joey|3| He's not even here
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| You guys
Rachel|1| You guys
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man
Rachel|1| He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him
Monica|2|
Rachel|1|  Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Yeah, you fogged Danny
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Please
Rachel|1| We did not fog Danny
Rachel|1| Who's Danny
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Dan just moved in downstairs
Joey|3| Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes
Joey|3| Nice fella
Joey|3| 
Monica|2| Oh he's nice
Monica|2| He's nice
Monica|2| Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog
Monica|2|
Danny|0| Yeah
Danny|0|
Rachel|1| Hi
Rachel|1| You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| We're-we're really sorry we fogged you
Monica|2|
Danny|0| Okay
Danny|0| 
Rachel|1| Hi
Rachel|1| Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something
Rachel|1|
Danny|0| Okay
Danny|0|
Danny|0| Yesss
Danny|0|
Rachel|1| Hi
Rachel|1| Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Yeah
Monica|2|
Danny|0| O-kay
Danny|0|
Monica|2| Wow
Monica|2| That guy is so rude
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Really
Rachel|1| What is with that guy
Rachel|1| I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Well you did a little bit
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| I totally forgive you
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Really
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Yes
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Hey
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Hey
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium
Phoebe|5| 
Monica|2| Crematorium Chris
Monica|2| Sure
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Oh my God
Rachel|1| Oh my God, look at these pelts
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1| Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature
Rachel|1| Not nature, fashion
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| This is fashion
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|  Okay, so to you, death is fashion
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| That's really funny
Phoebe|5|  Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia
Phoebe|5| I mean, you really thing this looks good
Phoebe|5|  'Cause I do
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6|  I know I miss you too
Ross|6| I can't wait to see you
Ross|6| I love you
Ross|6| Bye
Ross|6| 
Chandler|4| Okay, what is in here
Chandler|4| Rocks
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| So, rocks
Chandler|4| 
Ross|6| I'm really gonna miss this apartment
Ross|6| Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there
Ross|6| 
Joey|3| Ohh
Joey|3| Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little
Joey|3|
Ross|6| I loved this place
Ross|6| To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice…
Joey|3| You do have a choice
Joey|3|
Joey|3| Ross, why are you listening to her
Joey|3|
Joey|3| Are you, are you crazy
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Why
Ross|6|
Joey|3| It's not right what Emily wants you to do
Joey|3| She is totally--Owww
Joey|3|
Joey|3| Stop pinching me
Joey|3| Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right
Joey|3| Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy
Joey|3|
Ross|6| What's going on
Ross|6|
Joey|3| We all hate Emily
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Nooo
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| No, Ross, we do not hate Emily
Monica|2| We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yes
Joey|3| Yes
Joey|3| Unreasonable
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Unreasonable
Ross|6| How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married
Ross|6| You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work
Ross|6| All right, it's about compromise
Ross|6| Do you always like it
Ross|6| No
Ross|6| Do you do it
Ross|6| Yes
Ross|6| Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time
Ross|6| It's real life, okay
Ross|6| It's what grown-ups do
Ross|6| 
Phoebe|5| I think he's right
Phoebe|5| You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| God, I feel so guilty about Ross
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Oh, I know
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| I kinda feel like it's my fault
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Kind of
Chandler|4| If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out
Joey|3| 
Chandler|4| Well, I think it's very brave what you said
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| All right, I can't sit here anymore
Phoebe|5| I have to walk places
Phoebe|5| 
Chandler|4| Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat
Chandler|4| How about the whole animal rights thing
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice
Phoebe|5| Okay, I admit it
Phoebe|5| I love this coat
Phoebe|5| Okay, I—it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley
Phoebe|5|  Remember Phil Huntley
Phoebe|5| He was fine
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Hi
Rachel|1|
Danny|0| So you like the short hair better
Danny|0|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1| Yeti—I mean Danny
Rachel|1|
Danny|0| I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell
Danny|0|
Rachel|1| Oh
Rachel|1| Listen, I'm so sorry
Rachel|1| I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so…
Rachel|1| Y'know
Rachel|1|
Danny|0| Absolutely
Danny|0| Some people are just into appearances
Danny|0|
Rachel|1|  What
Rachel|1|
Danny|0| That's cool
Danny|0| Cool
Danny|0| 
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1| Hey
Rachel|1| No-no-no
Rachel|1| This not cool
Rachel|1| You don't even know me
Rachel|1|
Danny|0| Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog
Danny|0| 
Rachel|1| So from that you think you've got me all figured out
Rachel|1| Well, you don't
Rachel|1| Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here
Rachel|1|
Danny|0| Do you
Danny|0|
Rachel|1| Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants
Rachel|1|
Danny|0| Okay
Danny|0| 
Rachel|1| And stop saying that
Rachel|1| I hate that
Rachel|1|
Danny|0| Okay
Danny|0|
Rachel|1| Fine
Rachel|1| I judged you
Rachel|1| I made a snap judgement
Rachel|1| But you did it too
Rachel|1| And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement
Rachel|1| You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong
Rachel|1| What does that say about you
Rachel|1|
Danny|0| The pizza-place across the street any good
Danny|0|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Danny|0| I'm hungry
Danny|0| Wanna get some pizza
Danny|0| You can keep yelling if there's more
Danny|0|
Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1|
Danny|0| Stop saying that
Danny|0| I hate that
Danny|0|
Chandler|4| Uh, Ross
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Are you still mad at us
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Yep
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Oh good
Phoebe|5|" Because we have an ""I'm sorry"" song"
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Y'know what
Ross|6| I'm really not in the mood
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Look, Ross, I feel really bad
Joey|3| I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yeah, we are so sorry
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5|  You're kinda stepping on the song
Phoebe|5| 
Joey|3| Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Whatever you decide, whatever you do
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Look, this is hard enough
Ross|6| I really need you guys right now
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Yes
Phoebe|5| Exactly
Phoebe|5| And that's why…
Monica|2| Why don't you come over tonight
Monica|2| And I'll make you favorite dinner
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6| Thanks you guys
Ross|6| Pheebs are you wearing fur
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today
Joey|3|
Ross|6| You do, huh
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor
Joey|3| Right

Joey|3| See what I'm saying
Joey|3| I gotta lot of balls in the air
Joey|3|  Y'know what I mean
Joey|3| It's tough
Joey|3| Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone…
