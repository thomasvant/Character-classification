Chandler|4| Good-bye muscles
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information
Chandler|4| And I wanted to give it up I just—I didn't know what it was
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship
Chandler|4| Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth
Chandler|4|
Ross|6|  Hey
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Whoa, dude, look out
Joey|3| You almost crushed my hat
Joey|3| 
Ross|6| Sorry
Ross|6|
Chandler|4|  And the bunny got away
Chandler|4| 
Ross|6|  This would be the place where you explain the hat
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Oh
Joey|3| Yeah, look there's this play all right
Joey|3| And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy
Joey|3| A real clothes horse
Joey|3| So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| And you're gonna make them all disappear
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Done
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store

Ross|6|
Monica|2| Ohh my God, I'm so sorry
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| It's okay
Phoebe|5| Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool
Phoebe|5| 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2|  Not the way they're doing it
Monica|2| What, what happened
Monica|2| How did she die
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Pheebs, I'm so sorry
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| It was really sweet
Phoebe|5|" The last thing she said to me was; ""Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter"
Phoebe|5|""" And y'know what"
Phoebe|5| We will meet at the checkout counter
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear

Joey|3| All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Okay, it's missing something
Rachel|1| Ooh, I know
Rachel|1| Umm, okay
Rachel|1| 
Joey|3| Really
Joey|3| A purse
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| It's not a purse
Rachel|1| It's a shoulder bag
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| It looks like a women's purse
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| No Joey, look
Rachel|1| Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog
Rachel|1| Look
Rachel|1|  See look, men, carrying the bag

Phoebe|5|
Frank Sr.|0| Yes, yes I was
Frank Sr.|0|
Phoebe|5| Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A

Phoebe|5|
Frank Sr.|0| It really says that
Frank Sr.|0|
Frank Sr.|0|
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5| See

Frank Sr.|0| Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C
Frank Sr.|0|
Phoebe|5| Hmm, okay, total abandonment
Phoebe|5| Okay, reasons for abandonment, A
Phoebe|5| Top secret government work, B
Phoebe|5| Amnesia, or C
Phoebe|5| Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man
Phoebe|5|
Frank Sr.|0| Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much
Frank Sr.|0|  But umm… Oh, would you do me a favor
Frank Sr.|0| And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please
Frank Sr.|0| 
Phoebe|5| What
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Frank Sr.|0| Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note
Frank Sr.|0| Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out
Frank Sr.|0| So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please
Frank Sr.|0|
Phoebe|5| But you-you-you came to see Lilly
Phoebe|5|
Frank Sr.|0| Yeah, yeah
Frank Sr.|0| Why
Frank Sr.|0|

Frank Sr.|0|
Frank Sr.|0|
Phoebe|5| She's dead
Phoebe|5|
Frank Sr.|0| Are you sure
Frank Sr.|0|
Phoebe|5| Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake
Phoebe|5|
Frank Sr.|0| I can't believe this
Frank Sr.|0| I just—I can't believe this
Frank Sr.|0| How-how—Oh my God
Frank Sr.|0| How long ago
Frank Sr.|0|
Phoebe|5| 17 years ago
Phoebe|5|
Frank Sr.|0| Oh

Frank Sr.|0| Phoebe, I-I-I-umm,  Oops
Frank Sr.|0|  I just, I-I-I-I don’t, I don’t know what to say
Frank Sr.|0| I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty
Frank Sr.|0|
Phoebe|5| Yes
Phoebe|5| Well, that's neither here nor there
Phoebe|5|
Frank Sr.|0| So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left
Frank Sr.|0|
Phoebe|5| Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go
Phoebe|5|
Frank Sr.|0| All right
Frank Sr.|0| Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father
Frank Sr.|0|
Phoebe|5| That's a defense
Phoebe|5|
Frank Sr.|0| Yes
Frank Sr.|0| Yes it is
Frank Sr.|0| I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards
Frank Sr.|0| I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more
Frank Sr.|0|
Phoebe|5| You make up songs
Phoebe|5|
Frank Sr.|0| Well no, just-just that one
Frank Sr.|0| But, it was stupid
Frank Sr.|0| Let's see, how did it, how did it go
Frank Sr.|0| Umm
Frank Sr.|0|  
Frank Sr.|0| I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this
Frank Sr.|0| So, umm…
