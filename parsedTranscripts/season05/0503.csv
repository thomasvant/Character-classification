Phoebe|5| Hey
Phoebe|5|
Dr. Harad|0| Let's see what we got here
Dr. Harad|0| Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets
Dr. Harad|0|
Chandler|4| This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor
Chandler|4|
Dr. Harad|0| Oh no-no-no
Dr. Harad|0| Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli
Dr. Harad|0| The Fonz
Dr. Harad|0|
Chandler|4| All right
Chandler|4|
Frank|0| It's not that weird, is it
Frank|0|
Phoebe|5| It's very weird
Phoebe|5| I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| To be fair, he doesn’t seem to be impersonating Fonzie…
Phoebe|5|  What are you doing
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| Why are you defending him
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| Just get me another doctor
Phoebe|5| One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Again, it's not that he…
Chandler|4|  Oh-hey-hey-hey
Chandler|4| There you are
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Umm, listen there's something I think you should know
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse
Chandler|4| Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine
Chandler|4| I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Fine
Chandler|4| Maybe I will too
Chandler|4|
Joey|3|  Hey, you guys

Joey|3|  Get up
Joey|3| Get up
Joey|3| Get up
Joey|3| 
Ross|6| Okay, Phoebe, this Dr
Ross|6| Oberman

Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Hi
Phoebe|5| And you're going into what grade
Phoebe|5|
Dr. Oberman|0| Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early…
Phoebe|5|  Uh-huh, me too
Phoebe|5| Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor
Phoebe|5| 
Dr. Oberman|0| Oh no, I'm fully qualified to…
Phoebe|5| Shh
Phoebe|5| Doogie, shh
Phoebe|5| Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon

Joey|3|
Joey's Doctor|0| Kidney stones
Joey's Doctor|0|
Dr. Harad|0| All right, you're getting there

Phoebe|5| Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask
Phoebe|5| Y'know
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Phoebe, no
Rachel|1| This is, this is insane
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Oh, just ask him
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Me
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| I can't ask him
Phoebe|5| Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| All I'm saying is just talk to Frank
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5| Just, y'know, feel him out
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| No
Rachel|1| Forget it
Rachel|1| I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| You're right
Phoebe|5|

Joey's Doctor|0| Now, ordinarily Mr
Joey's Doctor|0| Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now
Joey's Doctor|0| Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra…
Joey|3|  Whoa-whoa
Joey|3| No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up
Joey|3| Okay
Joey|3| Up, up is not an option—what's a urethra
Joey|3|  Are you crazy
