Monica| You look cute in bubbles.
Chandler| Ehh, you're just liquored up.
Joey| Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
Chandler| I've had a very long, hard day.
Joey| Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Chandler| Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Joey| Okay.
Joey| You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
Chandler| For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!
Joey| All right!
Chandler| Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Monica| Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Chandler| Hey Joe!
Chandler| Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in 
Phoebe|  Hey!
Chandler| Hey, Pheebs!
Joey| Mornin' Pheebs!
Phoebe| I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver…
Joey|  Was his name Angus? 
Phoebe| What?
Joey| Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
Phoebe| Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway…
Monica| Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
Chandler| Uh, The Wheatsheaf.
Joey| Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh…
Monica| Bodington's!
All| Bodington's! Woohoo! 
Chandler| Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.
Phoebe| Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat—I don't want to talk about it.
Ross|  Hey!
All| Hey!
Joey| Hey, Ross, Bodington's!
Ross| Yeah! 
Joey| That was good beer.
Ross| Ohh…
Joey| Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
Ross| Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Joey| Later! 
Ross| Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Monica| Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually,  she should be here by now.
Ross| Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
Monica| No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Ross| Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know—Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?
Phoebe| So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
Ross| No, not since I lost her at the airport.
Chandler| I can't believe she can out run you man!
Ross| HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!!  Oh! You-you think you can be beat me? Let's go! Outside!!
Rachel|  Hi!
All| Hey! 
Ross| Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
Rachel| Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
Ross| That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
Rachel| Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. 
Ross| So, what? That's it?
Rachel| Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
Ross| Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best. 
Rachel| Oh no, you're the best.
Ross|  Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store!  Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
Chandler| Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
Monica| Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
Rachel|" What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, ""Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?"" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions."
Chandler| Oh that's not true.
Rachel| Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
Phoebe| London is stupid! Stupid!
Rachel| Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Phoebe| Oh… No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
Monica| I'll do it!
Rachel| That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
Chandler| Okay, I gotta go to work.
Chandler| And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back. 
Chandler| Pheebs!  Always a pleasure. 
Monica| Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Rachel| Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't—I still can't believe it. 
Monica| Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
Rachel| I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it …
Monica| Ohh. 
Rachel| …I mean it's my fault.
Monica| Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
Rachel| Oh my God! 
Monica| Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
Joey|  I bet it was about her a little.
Monica| If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther!  I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
Rachel| Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda…
Monica|  Oh, what about that guy over there?  Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Rachel| Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Monica| You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
Rachel| All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
Joey| Say that to him and you're golden. 
Phoebe|  Hey!
Rachel| Hey!
Joey| Hey, Pheebs!
Monica| We got out pictures back from London.  Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Phoebe|  Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me. 
Chandler| All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
Phoebe| No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
All| Sorry.
Monica| What happened?
Rachel| Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
Monica| See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
Rachel| Well…
Gunther|  Get out!
Monica| What took you so long?
Chandler| I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Monica| Oh, good. 
Chandler| So, thanks for having me over! Rach.  Pheebs. 
Joey|  See ya!!  What the hell was that?!
Monica| Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
Rachel| That's not European!
Phoebe| Well, it felt French.
Rachel| Oh God, I really had a good time!
Dave| Yeah, me too.  So, I guess this is it.
Rachel| Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
Dave| Yeah!
Rachel| Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
Dave| Okay, yeah!
Rachel| Umm, hi!
Ross| Hi.
Rachel| Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
Ross| She's doing her laundry.
Rachel| What's that? 
Ross| It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
Rachel| Oh, honey that's awful.
Ross| Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
Rachel| But, it's not raining.
Ross| I can't catch a break!
Rachel| Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right?  Hey, Dave!
Dave| Yeah?
Rachel| Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye!  Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
Monica|  Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Rachel| Yeah. 
Monica| What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Rachel| Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
Monica| I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Rachel| Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted…tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
Monica|  What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Rachel| Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
Monica| I make the decisions, and I say no.
Rachel| Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
Monica|" You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, ""I'm not fired!"" Ha!"
Rachel| Well… 
Monica| Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Joey|  Havin' some trouble?
Monica| Rachel locked the door.
Joey| I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
Monica| Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
Monica| Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
Rachel| No.
Monica| I really need to talk to you.
Rachel| Well, then talk!
Monica| Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Rachel| Yes!
Ross| What thing?
Monica| Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might  end up hurting.
Ross| Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.  My God, think of the massacre.
Rachel| I'm gonna do it.
Monica| All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
Rachel| But I…
Monica| Please!
Rachel| All right, fine.
Monica| Joey, I'm in!
Joey|  All right. Good deal.
All| Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
Joey| Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Phoebe| Yeah?
Joey| Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
Phoebe| Yeah?
Joey| All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
Phoebe| Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
Monica| Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Phoebe| Central… Park!
Joey| Yeah, all of us! All day!
Phoebe|" That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? ""Well, it's right by my house, all right!"" "
Chandler| Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea. 
Rachel|  Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—y'know—stop it!
Chandler| I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Phoebe| That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
Monica| Makes me wanna puke!  
Ross| Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
Joey| Phoebe!
Chandler| Hey, Pheebs!
Rachel| Phoebe, woo!
Phoebe| Okay, woo! Hi.
Chandler| Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little… Y'know, it didn't have any… It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
Phoebe| Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Joey| Mine!
Ross| Wait! It was my plan.
Joey| Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
Ross| And, I came up with Atlantic City.
Joey| Which, is the new plan!
Monica| Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Phoebe| Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
Monica| Come on Rach, let's go.
Rachel| Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
Monica| No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
Rachel| Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
Monica| Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
Rachel| Yeah, I-I don't care.
Monica| Okay. I-I can't watch. 
Rachel| What 'cha readin'?
Ross| The paper.
Rachel| Yeah, what's it about?
Ross| Events from around the globe.
Rachel| Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
Ross| Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized…
Rachel| Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Ross| Yeah. 
Rachel| Okay.
Ross| Go ahead.
Rachel| Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh,  I'm still in love with you Ross.
Ross| Wow. Umm… Huh… I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
Ross| What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
Rachel|  I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Ross| Why are you laughing?
Rachel|" Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel  was like, ""You are such an idiot!"""
Ross| Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
Rachel|  I'm sorry, that's not funny.
Ross|" Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is.  ""Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?"" Don't know! "
Rachel| Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
Ross| Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is…
Rachel| The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
Ross| That is what the thing is.
Rachel| Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
Ross| No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
Rachel| That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. 
Ross| No thank you for… Thank you.
Ross| Okay, let's go!
Chandler| Atlantic City!
Phoebe| Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones! 
Joey| Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
Monica| Oh my God! You're water broke!
The Guys| Ohh!
Phoebe| All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! 
All| Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
Chandler| Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
Ross| Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
Rachel| High-five, the babies are coming! 
Phoebe| Wait, wait, remember when my water broke? 
Monica| I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
Chandler| I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Chandler| Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Monica| Do you know anything about women?
Chandler| No.
Monica| That's all right. 
Chandler| Okay.
