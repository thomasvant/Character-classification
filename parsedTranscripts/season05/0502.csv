Rachel|1| Geller, why are you crying
Rachel|1|""" I mean, it was sooo humiliating"
Rachel|1| I felt like such an idiot
Rachel|1| I mean, it's all my fault

Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Oh that's not true
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Yes it is

Rachel|1| Phoebe, you were right
Rachel|1| I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Oh… No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| I'll do it
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| That's fine
Rachel|1| So Monica, you are now in control of my love life

Monica|2| I know, I know that wasn't about me
Monica|2|
Joey|3|  I bet it was about her a little
Joey|3|
Monica|2| If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere
Monica|2| I mean, look
Monica|2| Look, Gunther
Monica|2|  I mean, he's nice, he's cute
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda…

Monica|2| That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Oh, I don't know
Rachel|1| I don't know
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| You're going to talk to him
Monica|2| Y'know what
Monica|2| We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him
Monica|2|

Rachel|1| 
Monica|2| What is the matter with you
Monica|2|
Monica|2| Do you want to fall into the trap
Monica|2| Do you want to fall into the trap
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Ohh
Rachel|1| You did not drop any socks
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off
Monica|2| I mean, you listen to me
Monica|2| Now, I'm calling the shots
Monica|2| I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave
Monica|2| What the hell were you trying to do
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted…tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him
Rachel|1|
Monica|2|  What
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Monica|2| You cannot tell him that
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Why
Rachel|1| Why not
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| People love to hear that
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| I make the decisions, and I say no
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired
Rachel|1|

Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Yes
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| What thing
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons
Monica|2| Which I think is a really stupid idea
Monica|2| It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might  end up hurting
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky
Ross|6| I'm gonna use the phone
Ross|6| I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily
Ross|6|  My God, think of the massacre
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| I'm gonna do it
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea
Monica|2| Because I bet you, you can't
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| But I…
Monica|2| Please
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| All right, fine
Rachel|1|

Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Ohh, that's so nice
Phoebe|5| How great
Phoebe|5| Well, where
Phoebe|5| Where's the trip
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|

Rachel|1| Kissey
Rachel|1| Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—y'know—stop it
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Makes me wanna puke

Phoebe|5| Hi
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little… Y'know, it didn't have any… It-it, well it blew
Chandler|4| So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Ooh, Atlantic City
Phoebe|5| Oh, that's a great plan
Phoebe|5| Who's plan was that
Phoebe|5|

Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Yeah, I-I don't care
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Okay
Monica|2| I-I can't watch
Monica|2| 
Rachel|1| What 'cha readin'

Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1| Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong
Rachel|1| I mean, and you know how people can be wrong
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Sure
Ross|6| Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized…
Rachel|1| Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Yeah

Ross|6| 'Cause it's mean
Ross|6|
Rachel|1|  I'm so dead serious
Rachel|1| I'm totally serious
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Why are you laughing
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Because , because, I just heard it
Rachel|1| I heard it, and it's ridiculous
Rachel|1| I mean, you're married
Rachel|1| You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know
Rachel|1|" And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel  was like, ""You are such an idiot"
Rachel|1|""""
Ross|6| Well, well I am married
Ross|6| Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding
Ross|6|
Rachel|1|  I'm sorry, that's not funny
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Actually, it kinda is
Ross|6| My wife won't return my calls
Ross|6| I don't know where my wife is
Ross|6|"  ""Hey Ross, where's the Mrs"
Ross|6|
Ross|6|""" Don't know"
Ross|6| 
Rachel|1| Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Well, I kinda half to
Ross|6| I mean, because the thing is…
Rachel|1| The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| That is what the thing is
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right
Rachel|1| I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| No
Ross|6| No
Ross|6| No, I'm-I'm glad you did
Ross|6| Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| That's what I said
Rachel|1| Thank you for being so nice
Rachel|1|
