Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Uh-huh, that one
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair
Rachel|1| I'm just gonna grab a jacket
Rachel|1| When I get back, I want every little detail
Rachel|1|  Maybe that's him
Rachel|1| 
Monica|2|  Okay, umm, okay, umm…  It's just Joey and Ross
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Why aren't you guys at the movie
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Well, we were
Joey|3| But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out
Joey|3|
Ross|6| I had to talk loud because the movie was loud
Ross|6|
Joey|3|  He's talking to London
Joey|3|
Monica|2| But why
Monica|2|
Monica|2| Did he get in touch with Emily
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Well no, not yet
Joey|3| He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her
Joey|3|
Ross|6|  I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Ross
Joey|3| Way to suck up to the family
Joey|3|
Chandler|4|  Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh
Chandler|4| I'm so glad you guys are all here
Chandler|4| My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper
Chandler|4|
Joey|3|  Hey
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux
Chandler|4| No-no, vomit tux
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Vomit tux
Monica|2| Who vomited on—y'know what, what you up to Joe
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Oh that's great
Monica|2|
Joey|3| A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Ugh, PBS
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| What's wrong with PBS
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Ugh, what's right with them
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally
Phoebe|5| So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid
Phoebe|5| No one ever wrote back
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| All I got was a lousy key chain
Phoebe|5| And by that time I was living in a box
Phoebe|5| I didn't have keys
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed
Joey|3| Like-like you did with the babies
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV
Phoebe|5| This is totally selfish
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Whoa
Joey|3| Whoa
Joey|3| Whoa
Joey|3| What about you, having those babies for your brother
Joey|3| Talk about selfish
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| What-what are you talking about
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5| So
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish
Joey|3| Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Yes there are
Phoebe|5| There are totally good deeds that are selfless
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Well, may I ask for one example
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, it's… Y'know there's—no you may not
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| That's because all people are selfish
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Are you calling me selfish
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Are you calling you people
Joey|3|  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist
Joey|3| Okay
Joey|3| And you the deal on Santa Clause right
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| I'm gonna find a selfless good dead
Phoebe|5| I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius
Phoebe|5|

Emily|0|
Ross|6|  She's talking
Ross|6|
All|0|  Yay
All|0| 
Phoebe|5| Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| That he doesn't exist
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Right
Phoebe|5| 
Rachel|1| So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Uhh, yeah

Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Ohh, he's really shy
Monica|2| I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| I don’t care
Rachel|1| I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Really
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| That's what you heard
Chandler|4|  You said that
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| I might've said that
Monica|2|  Why is that funny
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Because I'm very happy for him
Chandler|4|  And you, you lucky dog
Chandler|4|
Ross|6|  Hi

Ross|6| She wants me to move to London
Ross|6|
Monica|2| But you live here
Monica|2|  You know that
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| What-what-what are you gonna do
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife
Monica|2|
Ross|6| It could happen
Ross|6|
Joey|3|  How ya doin'
Joey|3| Welcome
Joey|3| Good to see ya
Joey|3|
Stage Director|0| This will be your phone
Stage Director|0|
Joey|3| That's great
Joey|3| But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls
Joey|3|
Stage Director|0| No you answer it and take pledges
Stage Director|0|
Joey|3| But I'm the host
Joey|3|
Stage Director|0| No, Gary Collins is the host
Stage Director|0| You'll be answering the phones
Stage Director|0|
Joey|3| You don't seem to understand
Joey|3| See, I was Dr
Joey|3| Drake Remoray
Joey|3|
Stage Director|0| Well, here's your phone doctor
Stage Director|0| 
Phoebe|5| I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed
Phoebe|5| Y'know that old guy that lives next to me
Phoebe|5| Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop
Phoebe|5| But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies
Phoebe|5| Then I felt wonderful
Phoebe|5| That old jackass
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Maybe Joey's right
Rachel|1| Maybe all good deeds are selfish
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| I will find a selfless good deed
Phoebe|5| 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4|  Hey, Monica
Chandler|4| Can I ask you a cooking question
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Sure
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Chandler
Rachel|1|  Is he
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Why
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this
Chandler|4| 
Ross|6| All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben
Ross|6|
Emily|0| I understand that would be difficult
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Yeah, would you please consider moving here
Ross|6| I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that
Ross|6|
Emily|0| I don't know, it's just…
Ross|6| Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here
Ross|6| You have to come here so we can work this out
Ross|6|
Emily|0| All right
Emily|0|
Ross|6| All right, did you just say all right
Ross|6|
Emily|0| I did
Emily|0| Now I'm the idiot
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Oh, Emily that is, that is so great
Ross|6| It's gonna be so great
Ross|6| We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love
Ross|6|
Emily|0| Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Yes, tell me
Ross|6|
Emily|0| Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends
Emily|0|
Ross|6| I know
Ross|6| I am, I am so sorry
Ross|6|
Emily|0| And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Again, very sorry
Ross|6|
Emily|0| I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her
Emily|0| It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6| I love you
Ross|6|
Emily|0| All right
Emily|0| I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work
Emily|0|
Ross|6| Oh that is so great
Ross|6| That's…
Emily|0|  As long as you don't see Rachel anymore
Emily|0|
Ross|6| So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Yes
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Ooh-ohh
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Great
Monica|2|
Ross|6| No-no-no
Ross|6| Only if I promise never to see Rachel again
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Why
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| What
Monica|2|
Monica|2| You can't—what did you tell her
Monica|2|
Ross|6| I told her I'd have to think about it
Ross|6| I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision
Ross|6|  I'm actually asking you
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Yeah
Monica|2| But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| That's true
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| That's true
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| No, you cannot
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Thanks for the help, problem solved
Ross|6|

Gary Collins|0| All you have to do  is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to… 
Ross|6|  Okay, that's it
Ross|6| I cannot make this decision
Ross|6| It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate
Ross|6| 
Monica|2| A Magic Eight ball
Monica|2|
Monica|2| You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Ooh, it's not a toy
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Well, I don't know what else to do
Ross|6| I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30
Ross|6| So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it
Ross|6| 'Cause I-I got nothing

Joey|3|
Phoebe|5|  Hi Joey
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Hey Pheebs
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| I would like to make a pledge
Phoebe|5| I would like to donate $200
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| $200
Joey|3| Are you sure Pheebs
Joey|3| I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it
Phoebe|5| So there, a selfless good deed
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| And you don't a little good about donating the money
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| No, it sucks
Phoebe|5| I was saving up to buy a hamster
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| A hamster
Joey|3| What, those things are like 10 bucks
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, not the one I had my eye on
Phoebe|5|
Gary Collins|0|  It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total
Gary Collins|0| Thank you viewers
Gary Collins|0| The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers… Oh boy
Gary Collins|0| And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers,  Mr
Gary Collins|0| Joseph Tribbiani
Gary Collins|0|
Phoebe|5| Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV

Phoebe|5| 
Chandler|4|  Look, maybe I got carried away before
Chandler|4| But there's something you gotta know
Chandler|4| If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Keep talking
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| I mean I was nothing before you
Chandler|4| Call the other girls and ask
Chandler|4| Which wouldn't take long
Chandler|4| But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH…MY…GOD
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Really
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Oh-aw my God
Chandler|4| Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong
Chandler|4| We're too good
Chandler|4| We owe it, to sex
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Well, if we owe it
Monica|2|  Oh my… When is Joey gonna be home
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him
Chandler|4|  Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| But, I just cleaned the bathroom
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves
