Ross|6|
Joey|3| Sure, if you cared enough to call it first
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us

Monica|2| But what
Monica|2|
Joey|3|  She keeps punching me
Joey|3|
Monica|2| In that cute, little, sweet way she just did
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks
Joey|3| Okay

Phoebe|5| Mr
Phoebe|5| President
Phoebe|5|
Steve|0| I came to talk to you about Howard
Steve|0|
Ross|6| Howard
Ross|6|
Steve|0| Yeah, he's the handy man
Steve|0| He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing
Steve|0|
Ross|6| Oh that's nice
Ross|6|
Steve|0| Yeah
Steve|0| So, do you want to give a check
Steve|0| Or…
Ross|6| Oh
Ross|6| Uhh…
Steve|0| Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now
Steve|0| You can slip it under my door
Steve|0| 
Ross|6| No-no, it's not that, it's just… I-I just moved in
Ross|6|
Steve|0| Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years
Steve|0|
Ross|6| Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes
Ross|6|
Steve|0| Oh, okay, I get it
Steve|0| 
Ross|6| No wait, look
Ross|6| Look
Ross|6| I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard
Ross|6| I-I mean I don't know Howard
Ross|6|
Steve|0| Howard's the handy man
Steve|0|
Ross|6| Yes but too me he's just, man
Ross|6|
Steve|0| Okay, fine, whatever
Steve|0| Welcome to the building
Steve|0| 
Ross|6|  Ugh, can you believe that guy
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5| I really like his glasses
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| …so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me
Ross|6| A little kid spit on my knee
Ross|6| Y'know what I'm gonna do
Ross|6| I'm gonna throw a party
Ross|6| That's right
Ross|6| For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy
Ross|6| I am not a cheap guy
Ross|6| I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in
Ross|6| A man with principles
Ross|6|
Chandler|4|  Sounds like a fun party
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Hmm
Rachel|1| Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks
Rachel|1| The party's gonna cost you way more than that
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| It doesn't matter
Ross|6| It's my principles
Ross|6| We're talking about my principles
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Oh, they'll like me
Ross|6| Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY
Ross|6| Okay, I gotta run
Ross|6| I gotta go get some nametags
Ross|6| 
Rachel|1| And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica
Chandler|4| I don't want you putting any ideas in her head
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Wh-wh-why
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Well, because she loves you and because you love her
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Hey, Chandler, don't freak out
Rachel|1| I'm telling you something you already know
Rachel|1| Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies
Rachel|1| And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| I don't see it that way
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date
Chandler|4| Now, who's to say what she wants
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| I’m right
Chandler|4| I'm right
Chandler|4| Am I right
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| No, you're right, you are absolutely right
Rachel|1| I mean that makes, that makes everything different
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| It's not different at all, is it
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Not unless different means the same
Rachel|1|
Katie|0| You were so funny with that waiter
Katie|0| You're such a nut
Katie|0| 
Joey|3|  Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny
Joey|3|
Katie|0| No, you make them funny
Katie|0| You're the funny one
Katie|0| 
Joey|3| Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk
Joey|3| Okay
Joey|3| Umm, look I like you
Joey|3| I-I really do, I like you a lot
Joey|3| Okay
Joey|3| But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat
Joey|3|
Katie|0| Aww, like I could hurt you
Katie|0| Are you making fun of my size
Katie|0| Don't make fun of me because of my size
Katie|0| 
Monica|2| Isn't this great
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Hmm
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Couldn't you just stay like this forever
Monica|2|  Chandler
Monica|2| Couldn't you just stay here forever
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever
Chandler|4| 
Monica|2| Are you okay
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah, I'm cool
Chandler|4| Casual
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| What-what are you doing
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| I'm just hanging out
Chandler|4| Y'know, having fun
Chandler|4| Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Man, I knew it
Monica|2| I knew you were going to do this
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| What
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Well, you do want all that stuff, right
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Oh and you know what I want
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yes
Chandler|4| You want babies
Chandler|4| You have baby fever
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| I do not have baby fever
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage
Chandler|4| I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Have you lost your mind
Monica|2| Chandler, this isn't about me
Monica|2| This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Nah-uh
Chandler|4| I know you
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| You don't know everything
Monica|2| Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you
Monica|2| Hmm
Monica|2| And did you know that the only baby around here is you
Monica|2|
Monica|2| And did you know that I can't even look at you right now
Monica|2|
Monica|2| 
Chandler|4| Well, I did not know that
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| It's gonna be okay, right
Chandler|4| I mean she's not gonna leave me
Chandler|4| This is, this is fixable
Chandler|4|
Ross|6|
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| By me
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Oh, no
Ross|6|
Joey|3| No-no
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Yeah, big
Joey|3|
Joey|3| Uh-oh, shht
Joey|3| The Misses
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Gunther, can I get a coffee  to go
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Monica
Chandler|4| 
Monica|2| I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Just tell me what I need to do to make things right
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| What
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Well, that's what we do
Chandler|4| Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Really
Monica|2| I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor
Monica|2| You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself
Monica|2| All right
Monica|2| Y'know what
Monica|2| If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one
Monica|2| 
Ross|6| Phoebe
Ross|6| 
Phoebe|5| Oh, hi Ross
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| What are you doing

Phoebe|5| Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Phoebe
Ross|6| I can't believe you gave them money
Ross|6| I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, but they didn't ask me
Phoebe|5| Y'know
Phoebe|5| This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger
Phoebe|5| That's always fun to be
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Yeah, but you're making me look bad
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| No I'm not
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5| If anything I'm making you look better
Phoebe|5| They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit
Phoebe|5|
Steve|0|  Oh hey, Pheebs
Steve|0|
Phoebe|5| Hey

Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding
Joey|3| Y'know
Joey|3| I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love

Phoebe|5|  That's what I'm saying
Phoebe|5| 
Ross|6|  Phoebe
Ross|6| Phoebe
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Ooh
Phoebe|5| 
Ross|6| Look, this is a disaster
Ross|6| Can't I please just go
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5| I'm talking you up to people
Phoebe|5| Just give it a little time, all right
Phoebe|5| Relax, get something to eat
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| So uh, what did you tell them about me
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily
Phoebe|5| Y'know, try to get some sympathy
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Ohh
Ross|6| 
Phoebe|5| But somehow you came off as the bad guy
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| What
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, I think I told it wrong
Phoebe|5| Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6|  Ohh, this cake is really good
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Oh, okay, see
Phoebe|5| Things are looking up already
Phoebe|5|
Guest #2|0|  Oh my God
Guest #2|0| Someone cut Howard's cake
Guest #2|0|  Who would do a think like that
Guest #2|0|
Steve|0| 3-B
Steve|0|
All|0| Oh yeah, aww
All|0|
Steve|0| Okay, you got your free food

Guest #3|0|
All|0| Yeah, get out
All|0| Now
All|0|
Steve|0| Go back to 3-B, 3-B
Steve|0|
Phoebe|5| All right, everyone calm down
Phoebe|5| Everyone calm down
Phoebe|5| I have something that I would like to say
Phoebe|5| Who here likes Ross
Phoebe|5|  Of course you don't like him
Phoebe|5|" He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, ""Who hear likes Ross,"" and he's wearing two nametags"
Phoebe|5|  I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all
Phoebe|5| But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous
Phoebe|5| I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right
Phoebe|5| I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid
Phoebe|5| And okay, you guys   Gold-digger,  cradle robbing perv
Phoebe|5| So, I think you all know what I mean
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things
Phoebe|5| I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Oh wow, yeah
Ross|6| See, I did not get that
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Where's Monica
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| Where is she
Chandler|4| I need to talk to her
Chandler|4| It's urgent
Chandler|4| Is she here
Chandler|4|
Monica|2|  I'm Monica
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| I need to talk to you, it's urgent
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Okay
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking
Chandler|4| And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this
Chandler|4| 
Monica|2| Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Chandler|4|  Monica…
Monica|2| No-no, don't-don't-don't do it
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Will you marry me
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Oh-no
Ross|6| No
Ross|6| No
Ross|6|
Joey|3| What a bad idea
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Ohhhh, I cannot look at it
Rachel|1| 
Monica|2| Chandler, why are you doing this
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| I don't know
Chandler|4| But I know I'm not afraid to do this
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Chandler
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| I'm doing this because I'm sorry
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy
Chandler|4| Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married
Chandler|4|  Will you be my wife
Chandler|4|
Monica|2|  Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Honey
Monica|2| Do you know that none of that stuff came from me
Monica|2|
Monica|2| I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys
Chandler|4| 
Monica|2| Who
Monica|2| Two divorces and Joey
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Hey
Ross|6|
Joey|3| She's right y'know
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Yeah, but still, cheap shot
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Y'know what
Monica|2| Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own
Monica|2| Well, you're not ready for that
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| I didn't think I was
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love
Chandler|4| Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3| Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife
Joey|3|
Ross|6| No, I will not
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Oh, it's okay
Joey|3| You don't have to be so mean about it
Joey|3|
Ross|6| You're right, I'm sorry
Ross|6| Will you marry me
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you
Rachel|1| But I'm not sure, Chandler
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Okay, how long is this going to go on
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time
Monica|2|
Ross|6| This is fun
Ross|6|" Hey Rach, remember that whole ""We were on a break thing"
Ross|6|""" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me"
Ross|6| 
Chandler|4| That's not funny
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| That's not funny at all
Joey|3|
