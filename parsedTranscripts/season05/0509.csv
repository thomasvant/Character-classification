Joey|3| You guys keep embarrassing me
Joey|3|  Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom and I didn't know what to say, so I said it was mine and-and that I was playing a woman in a play
Joey|3| And one thing led to another and 
Monica|2|  Wow
Monica|2| And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Yeah, it was

Chandler|4|  All this lying has been hard on us too
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Well, yeah actually
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| We'll try to be more careful okay
Monica|2| It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| We are
Monica|2| Help us
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Help

Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Yeah

Ross|6| My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich
Ross|6| I can't believe someone ate it
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Ross, it's just a sandwich
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Just a sandwich
Ross|6| Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted
Ross|6| That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life
Ross|6| Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but 
Ross|6|  That-that would be incredible
Ross|6| Thank you so much
Ross|6| I-I still can't believe someone ate it
Ross|6|
Ross|6| I mean, look, I left a note and everything
Ross|6| 
Chandler|4|  Knock-knock
Chandler|4| Who's there
Chandler|4| Ross Geller's lunch
Chandler|4| Ross Geller's lunch, who

Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food
Phoebe|5| You gotta scare people off
Phoebe|5| I learned that living on the street
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Really
Ross|6|
Ross|6| So what would you say Pheebs
Ross|6|" Stuff like uh, ""Keep your mitts off my grub"
Ross|6|""""
Chandler|4| Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff
Phoebe|5| 
All|0| Whoa
All|0| Ohh
All|0|
All|0|
Monica|2| Phoebe, you are a bad ass
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| Phoebe
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Well, he stabbed me first
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1|  Sorry I'm late, but I left late
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| So Pheebs, what is the book about
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| I thought you said you read it in high school
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England
Phoebe|5| Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character
Phoebe|5| I totally get symbolism
Phoebe|5|
The Teacher|0| How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green
The Teacher|0|
Rachel|1| Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story
Rachel|1|
The Teacher|0| Well, that's sort of a given, but yes
The Teacher|0| Anyone else
The Teacher|0|
Rachel|1| Oh-oh-oh, symbolism
Rachel|1| And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character
Rachel|1|
The Teacher|0| Excellent
The Teacher|0| What Rachel has shrewdly observed here…
Phoebe|5|  You completely stole my answer
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Well, honey that was pretty obvious
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Well how would you know
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| You didn't even read it
Phoebe|5|
The Teacher|0| What do you think
The Teacher|0| You in the blue shirt
The Teacher|0|
Phoebe|5| I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers
Phoebe|5|
The Teacher|0| Would ya care to venture one
The Teacher|0|
Phoebe|5| Would you care to venture one
Phoebe|5|
The Teacher|0| Are you just repeating what I'm saying
The Teacher|0|
Phoebe|5| Are you just repeating what I'm saying
Phoebe|5|
The Teacher|0| All right, let's move on
The Teacher|0|
Phoebe|5| Okay then
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid
Rachel|1| I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you
Rachel|1|
Ross|6|  Phoebe
Ross|6| 
Phoebe|5| Yeah
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Phoebe
Ross|6| You're note, amazing
Ross|6| Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me
Ross|6| Yeah, a guy called me mental
Ross|6| Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller
Monica|2|
Ross|6| That was the water fountain
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6|
Ross|6| Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want
Ross|6|  Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee

Joey|3|
Monica|2| We're so sorry
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Well, I'm telling everyone about you
Joey|3| That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| No-no, wait
Chandler|4| There's got to be a better explanation
Chandler|4| You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah, I like that
Joey|3| But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Oh—I don't know
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Okay, just wait, please

Dr. Leedbetter|0| 
Ross|6| Oh no, you-you don't understand

Dr. Leedbetter|0|  A sandwich
Dr. Leedbetter|0|
Ross|6| Yeah

Dr. Leedbetter|0| It was a simple mistake
Dr. Leedbetter|0| It could happen to anyone
Dr. Leedbetter|0|
Ross|6|  Oh-oh really

Ross|6|
Dr. Leedbetter|0| No
Dr. Leedbetter|0|
Ross|6| Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it
Ross|6|
Dr. Leedbetter|0| There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind
Dr. Leedbetter|0|

Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Dr. Leedbetter|0| Now-now calm down

Rachel|1|  So umm, what's this book about
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| You didn't read this one either
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| What
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Vogue
Rachel|1| Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5| You should've read it yourself
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Come on Phoebe
Rachel|1| Don’t be such a goodie-goodie
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Fine
Phoebe|5| Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not
Phoebe|5| She's a cyborg
Phoebe|5| 
Rachel|1| A cyborg
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| Isn't that like a robot
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time
Phoebe|5|
The Teacher|0|  Sorry I'm late
The Teacher|0| Let's get started
The Teacher|0| So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre
The Teacher|0|
Phoebe|5| Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights
Phoebe|5|
The Teacher|0| Well, go ahead Rachel
The Teacher|0|
Rachel|1| Uh, thank you Phoebe
Rachel|1| Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time
Rachel|1|
The Teacher|0| If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right
The Teacher|0|
Rachel|1| Yeah, well, feminism yes, but also the robots
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Hey
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Hey
Monica|2| Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview
Monica|2| 
Chandler|4|  You're naked in this picture
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| I know
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Ross
Chandler|4|
Ross|6|  Hey Chandler
Ross|6|  Monica
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Ross, are you okay
Monica|2|
Ross|6| I'm fine
Ross|6| I saw a psychiatrist at work today
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Why
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Ross|6| On account of my rage
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Which I may say, right now, is out of control
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| He gave me a pill for it
Ross|6|
Monica|2| A pill
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Uh-huh
Ross|6| Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer
Ross|6| And I thought was a good idea so, I took it
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| And you're okay with that
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| I don't know
Ross|6| It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich
Ross|6|
Rachel|1|  Ugh, that was so embarrassing
Rachel|1| I can't believe you let me go on and on like that
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5|  I'm sorry
Phoebe|5| It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop
Phoebe|5| 
Rachel|1| That was not funny
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Well, I snapped
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5| You weren't taking the class seriously
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Phoebe, come on
Rachel|1| What is the big deal
Rachel|1| I thought this was going to be something we could do together
Rachel|1| Y'know, I thought it would be fun
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Well, yeah
Phoebe|5| Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn
Phoebe|5| Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Ohh
Rachel|1| Oh, so you really wanted to learn
Rachel|1| Yeah, y'know, Pheebs I just wanted to have fun
Rachel|1| Ohh, you know who you should go with
Rachel|1|
Monica|2|  I know

Chandler|4| 
Rachel|1| Yes
Rachel|1| He has a naked picture of Monica

Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| Look
Rachel|1| 
Ross|6|  Dude

Ross|6| 
Monica|2|  Give me that
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| All right, wait
Phoebe|5| Just wait
Phoebe|5| Everybody just calm down
Phoebe|5| Okay
Phoebe|5| Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| No
Joey|3| I am not a pervert
Joey|3| Okay
Joey|3| It's just… I just… Kinda…
Chandler|4| All right, look
Chandler|4| Look
Chandler|4| I think I can explain this
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Thank you
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Joey's a sex addict
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3| What
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Joey|3|  No I'm not
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Monica|2| It's okay
Monica|2| It's good
Monica|2| It's good
Monica|2| It's a disease
Monica|2|
Joey|3| No
Joey|3| No
Joey|3| I am not a sex addict
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Yes you are
Monica|2| That's the only way to explain all this stuff
Monica|2|
Joey|3| No it isn't
Joey|3| No, it's not
Joey|3| Because you can also explain it with the truth
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Well, what is the truth
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Yeah, what's going on
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| What's going on
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3|  I slept with Monica
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Well let's…
Chandler|4|let's see what everybody thinks of that
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Oh no
Monica|2|
Ross|6| You slept with my sister
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London
Joey|3|
Ross|6| This is not good for my rage
Ross|6| 
Rachel|1| Monica, is this true
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Of course it's true
Joey|3| How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Yes it's true
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Ahh—oy
Joey|3| That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London
Joey|3| Right Monica
Joey|3|
Monica|2| I guess I wanted to keep it  as a souvenir
Monica|2| 
Ross|6| My God Monica
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Are you sure Joe
Chandler|4| Are you sure you're not just a sex addict
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| No
Joey|3| If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3| She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| That makes sense
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| And the video camera
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Uhh, Monica
Joey|3|
Monica|2| I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey
Monica|2|
Joey|3| But sadly I could not be enticed
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Unbelievable
Ross|6| I mean you really kept Joey's underwear
Ross|6|
Ross|6| Why
Ross|6| Why would you do that
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Monica|2| I'm Monica
Monica|2| I'm disgusting
Monica|2| I stalk guys and keep their underpants
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not
Joey|3| Eh
Joey|3| All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket
Joey|3| I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs
Joey|3| 
Phoebe|5| I really thought you making a good point
Phoebe|5| I mean y'know, until you got cut off
Phoebe|5|
A Female Student|0| Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica
A Female Student|0|
Phoebe|5| I don't know
Phoebe|5| I didn't come with her
