Rachel|1|
Joey|3| So did that do anything for ya
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Y'know what
Ross|6| I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| But your divorce isn't even final yet
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Just the one divorce in '99
Ross|6| Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year
Ross|6| I am gonna make myself happy
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Do you want us to leave the room, or
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before
Ross|6| That my friends is my New Year's resolution
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Ooh
Phoebe|5| That's a good one
Phoebe|5| Mine is to pilot a commercial jet
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| That's good one too, Pheebs
Chandler|4| Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us
Monica|2|
Ross|6| In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us
Ross|6| Eh, y'know what, better yet
Ross|6| A week
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| I'll take that bet my friend
Chandler|4|" And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the ""new thing you do that day"
Chandler|4|"""  And it starts right now"
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Ohh
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| Really
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| How come
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume
Joey|3| I would love it would be great if one of those was true
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Do you want me to teach you
Phoebe|5| I'm a great teacher
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Really
Joey|3| Who-who have you taught
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Well, I taught me and I love me
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Yeah that'd be great
Joey|3| Thanks Pheebs
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Op, look
Rachel|1| Claire forgot her glasses
Rachel|1| And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| I don't gossip
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip
Rachel|1| I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1| They were like this
Rachel|1|

Chandler|4| That's not what I had in mind
Chandler|4| See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants
Chandler|4| You see, they're very tight
Chandler|4|  Maybe there's something in that area
Chandler|4|
Ross|6|" Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, ""Wow,  I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before"

Joey|3| Nice
Joey|3|
Ross|6| No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat
Ross|6| Look, I-I can't put them back on
Ross|6| I can't
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Oh
Joey|3| That is quite a situation
Joey|3| Uh, do you see any like, powder
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Powder
Ross|6| Yeah
Ross|6| Yeah, I have powder
Ross|6|  
Joey|3| Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Yeah, okay, hold on
Ross|6|   They're not coming on man
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Umm, do you see any—oh, Vaseline
Joey|3| 
Ross|6| Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion

Joey|3|
Ross|6| Hold on
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Ross
Joey|3| You okay
Joey|3|
Ross|6| They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Really
Joey|3|
Joey|3| Uhh, what color is it
Joey|3|
Ross|6| What difference does that make
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference
Joey|3|
Rachel|1|  Joey, do you have a minute
Rachel|1|
