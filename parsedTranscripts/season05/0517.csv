Joey|3|  Yeah, yeah, that's her
Joey|3| But y'know what
Joey|3| Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Why
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Because it's impossible to find her apartment
Joey|3| She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something
Joey|3|
Monica|2| What are you talking about
Monica|2|  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left
Monica|2|
Joey|3| No
Joey|3| No
Joey|3| No
Joey|3| She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left
Joey|3|
Monica|2| No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby
Monica|2| And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway
Monica|2| You've been counting wrong
Monica|2|

Joey|3| 
Rachel|1| Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again
Rachel|1|
Mr. Zelner|0| That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped
Mr. Zelner|0|
Rachel|1|  Okay
Rachel|1| Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you
Rachel|1|
Mr. Zelner|0| Fair enough
Mr. Zelner|0|
Rachel|1| Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah,  who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why
Rachel|1| I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage
Rachel|1| When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no
Rachel|1| That shows integrity
Rachel|1| And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage
Rachel|1|  Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage
Rachel|1| And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious
Rachel|1| {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against
Rachel|1| So she didn't want to sue him
Rachel|1|  Don't worry, I had to look it up too
Rachel|1|} So there you go, you got, you got  courage, you got integrity, you got  courage again, and not litigious
Rachel|1| Look Mr…
Mr. Zelner|0| Zelner
Mr. Zelner|0|
Rachel|1| Zelner
Rachel|1| Right
Rachel|1| I knew that
Rachel|1| I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it
Rachel|1|
Mr. Zelner|0| Y'know what
Mr. Zelner|0| I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot
Mr. Zelner|0|
Rachel|1|  Oh
Rachel|1| You are
Rachel|1|
Mr. Zelner|0| Um-hmm
Mr. Zelner|0|
Rachel|1| Really
Rachel|1| Oh thank you
Rachel|1| Oh… Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug
Rachel|1|
Mr. Zelner|0| Yes
Mr. Zelner|0|
Rachel|1| Okay, well then how about a handshake
Rachel|1|  Oh God I'm sorry
Rachel|1| Oh God, I'm sorry
Rachel|1| I did not mean to touch that—I mean you there
Rachel|1| There
Rachel|1| Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so—Hey
Rachel|1| I'll see you Monday
Rachel|1| 
Phoebe|5| You tired Chandler
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| You better believe he's tired, after the day we had
Monica|2| If you know what I mean
Monica|2| You know what I mean
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean
Chandler|4|
Gary|0| So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you
Gary|0|
Chandler|4| Oh yeah, it's so cool
Chandler|4|  Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100
Chandler|4|  That's pee-pee
Chandler|4| 
Monica|2| Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| Ohh,  umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here
Phoebe|5|
Gary|0| Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so…
Monica|2| You didn't
Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| We did
Phoebe|5| We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| The park huh
Monica|2| A public place
Monica|2|
Gary|0| Uh-huh
Gary|0|
Monica|2| I hear ya
Monica|2| Excuse me for just a second
Monica|2| 
Monica|2| Hi Chandler
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Monica
Chandler|4| This is the Men's room
Chandler|4|  Isn't it
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Yes it is
Monica|2| You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual
Monica|2| Haven't you
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| No
Chandler|4| And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out
Chandler|4| Monica, this is getting ridiculous
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Come on, we can't let them win
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase
Monica|2|
Chandler|4|  So
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| I feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Oh wow
Chandler|4| Is that what this all have been about
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah that was great
Chandler|4| That was really great
Chandler|4| But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Really
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah
Chandler|4| I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before
Chandler|4| Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible
Chandler|4| And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting
Chandler|4| 
Monica|2| That is so sweet
Monica|2| I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yeah
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Yeah
Monica|2| 
Chandler|4| Y'know what I just realized
Chandler|4| You just freaked out about our relationship
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Did not
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Yes you did
Chandler|4| Admit it
Chandler|4| You freaked out
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Okay, I freaked out a little
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Little
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| You freaked out big time
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| And I fixed it
Chandler|4| We have switched places
Chandler|4| I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up
Chandler|4|   And now we're back
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1|  I cannot believe Ross is buying this
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Thank God
Monica|2| I can't watch him anymore
Monica|2|
Chandler|4|  You guys ready fore the movies
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1| Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine
Rachel|1|
