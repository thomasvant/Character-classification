Rachel| Good, you guys are all here!
Ross| Hey! What's up?
Rachel| Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!
All| Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
Rachel| I know!
Joey| Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
Rachel| Wh-what?!
Joey| I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
Rachel| Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!
Phoebe| Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
Rachel| Yeah.
Phoebe| You wanna work on your interview skills?
Rachel| O-okay!
Phoebe| Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
Rachel| Hi. 
Phoebe| Very good handshake, good wrist action.
Monica| Let me try. 
Phoebe| Okay.  Oh my God! What did I ever do to you?! 
Monica| Did I squeeze it too hard?
Phoebe| Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
Joey| That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday,  same as the day before.
Monica| Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Joey| Nope. Op, wait! There he goes. 
Joey|  Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay.  Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady.   Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.
Monica| Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Joey| Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that.  Okay, here goes.  How  you  a-doin'?   It worked! She's waving me over.  Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor…
Monica|  Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Joey| Tell me about it, huh?  Oh no-no-no, I'm not with her, she's just Monica!  Ewwuck! 
Ross| Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?
Joey| This is your place?
Ross| Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing. 
Joey| But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man! 
Joey| Ugh!!
Monica| What happened?
Joey| I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something.  Damn! She's not there anymore. Oh, l-l-look, Ross is doing his 'Watching TV' bit. 
Monica| No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV. 
Gary's Radio| We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Gary| Okay, now I've really have to go!
Phoebe| But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
Gary| I know, but it's my job, sweethart!
Phoebe| Okay, then maybe I can come too!
Gary's Radio| Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
Phoebe| All right, you go. 
Gary| Bye-bye.
Phoebe| 'Kay, bye!
Phoebe| Oh God!
Monica| What?
Phoebe| Oh I just miss him so much!
Monica| Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Phoebe| Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
Monica| I know it is the best.
Phoebe| So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
Monica| What? It's still going on.
Phoebe| Come on, seriously! When did it end?
Monica| I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
Phoebe| Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
Monica|   What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don’t you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Phoebe|  God, I woke the beast. Sorry.  I was wrong obviously, I just—I misspoke. It's okay.
Monica| Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Chandler|  Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
Monica| You are so cute. 
Chandler| Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
Rachel| Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
Joey| Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
Rachel| No!
Chandler| So what happened?
Rachel|" Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, ""Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!""  Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!"
Joey| What happened?
Rachel|  All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me… Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh… 
Joey| You kissed him?!
Rachel| Well, I didn't know what else to do!
Chandler| Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
Rachel| Thanks Chandler.
Monica|  Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
Rachel| I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
Monica| Yes!
Joey| I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
Rachel| What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Joey| Yeah!  No?
Monica| A kiss? What are you talking about?
Rachel|" I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause ""Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"""
Chandler| Come on, Rach.
Rachel| Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
Monica| He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Rachel| Maybe. I-I don't know—Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Joey| Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on.  She's back! Hot girl's back!
Rachel| Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
Joey| No, in Ross's building!  She's back! She's back!  Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second.  Got it! 
Chandler| I gotta check out this hot girl!  There she is! 
Joey| Damnit!! Did you move?!
Ross| Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place.  I'm Ross.
The Old Man| Yes?
Joey|  Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
The Old Man| No. I'm all alone.
Joey| Yeah. Sorry about that.  Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?
The Little Girl| Daddy!!
Joey| Later!  Oh man!  Hot girl! Hot girl!!
Mr. Zelner| Hi Rachel!
Rachel| Hi!
Mr. Zelner| Come on in.
Mr. Zelner| It's really nice to see you again.
Rachel| Thank you.
Mr. Zelner|  Oh Rachel, uhh… 
Rachel| What?
Mr. Zelner| Just ah… 
Rachel| Excuse me?
Mr. Zelner| Here let me… 
Rachel|  Wh-whoa! All right, okay-okay, I see, I see what's going on here! Now listen, look-look, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead! Now even though I , hey-hey-hey, even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me. I do not want, this job that bad. Good day, sir. 
Rachel|  Ugh, you will not believe what that sleaze-ball from Ralph Lauren did too me!
Rachel| Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?
Ross| You got ink on your lip.
Rachel| Oh.  Ohhhhhhhhh….
Chandler|  So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?
Gary| I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
Chandler| Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you… 
Gary| Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
Monica| Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
Phoebe| Oh we can't, we already have plans.
Monica| What are you doing?
Phoebe| Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
Monica|  Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
Phoebe| You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Monica| Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Phoebe| Yeah!
Monica| Okay.  Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
Chandler| Uh, yeah.
Monica| Okay.  We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Chandler| Why?
Monica| 'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Chandler| Ohh, so?
Monica| So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Chandler| Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
Ross|  Hey!
The Man|  Excuse me.  You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
Ross|  Who isn't? 
Ross| I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
The Hot Girl| I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
Ross| Nevermind! 
The Hot Girl| No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
Ross| I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm…
The Hot Girl| Jen.
Ross| Jen, I know this may sound a little… But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or…
Jen| Sure! That would be nice.
Ross| Umm?
Jen| Oh! My number is on there.  Give me a call.
Ross| I will give you a call.
Jen| I'll see you later. 
Ross| Okay!
Jen| I forgot my paper. 
Chandler| That was amazing!
Monica| Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
Chandler| That was amazing.
Monica| We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
Chandler| No, you're the best.
Monica| No, you're the best.
Chandler| No, you're the best.
Monica| I am the best.
Joey|  Hey guys!  What 'cha been doin'? 
Monica|  Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
Joey| I don't know. But I can see through your sheet.  Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
Monica| Why?
Joey| Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
Monica| What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
Joey| No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
Monica| No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
Joey| I did not know that! Thank you Monica.  I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
Ross| So uhh, you ready?
Jen| Sure, I'll just get my coat.  Could you get that?
Ross| Sure.  Joey…
Joey| Dahhhhh!!  No! Noooo!! 
Rachel| Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
Mr. Zelner| That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Rachel|  Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
Mr. Zelner| Fair enough.
Rachel| Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah,  who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage.  Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him.  Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got  courage, you got integrity, you got  courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr…
Mr. Zelner| Zelner.
Rachel| Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.
Mr. Zelner| Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
Rachel|  Oh! You are?
Mr. Zelner| Um-hmm.
Rachel| Really? Oh thank you! Oh… Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
Mr. Zelner| Yes!
Rachel| Okay, well then how about a handshake?  Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that—I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so—Hey! I'll see you Monday! 
Phoebe| You tired Chandler?
Monica| You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Chandler| Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
Gary| So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
Chandler| Oh yeah, it's so cool.  Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100.  That's pee-pee. 
Monica| Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Phoebe| Ohh,  umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
Gary| Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so…
Monica| You didn't!
Phoebe| We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
Monica| The park huh? A public place.
Gary| Uh-huh.
Monica| I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second! 
Monica| Hi Chandler.
Chandler| Monica! This is the Men's room!  Isn't it?
Monica| Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
Chandler| No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Monica| Come on, we can't let them win!
Chandler| Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Monica| Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
Chandler|  So?
Monica| I feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore.
Chandler| Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Monica| Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
Chandler| Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Monica| Really?
Chandler| Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting. 
Monica| That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
Chandler| Yeah?
Monica| Yeah. 
Chandler| Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Monica| Did not.
Chandler| Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Monica| Okay, I freaked out a little.
Chandler| Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up!   And now we're back.
Rachel|  I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
Monica| Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Chandler|  You guys ready fore the movies?
Rachel| Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine. 
Ross|  Man! They cannot get enough!
