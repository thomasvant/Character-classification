Phoebe|5|  Oh hey, you guys, look
Phoebe|5| Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Ohh, I'm gonna miss that big old squishy butt
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| And we're done with the chicken fried rice
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Hey
Ross|6| Hey
Ross|6| If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place
Ross|6|
All|0| Good idea
All|0| Yes
All|0|
Ross|6| It would be so cool to live across from you guys
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Hey, yeah
Joey|3| Then we could do that telephone thing
Joey|3| Y'know, you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Or we can do the actual telephone thing
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Oh my God
Ross|6| I love this apartment
Ross|6| Isn't it perfect
Ross|6|
Ross|6| I can't believe I never realized how great it is
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| It's amazing
Phoebe|5| You better hurry up and fill out an application or I'm gonna beat you to it
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6|  Ohh
Ross|6| 
Rachel|1| Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom
Rachel|1| 
Phoebe|5|  Oh, look

Rachel|1| Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Actually, it looks really good
Ross|6| 
Phoebe|5|  Get in here
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| 
Phoebe|5| You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or—Oh
Phoebe|5| All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Uh-huh, doing it
Rachel|1| Doing it
Rachel|1| Phone doing it
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5| Oh, I can't believe it
Phoebe|5| I mean I think it's great

Phoebe|5|
Joey|3|  Hey guys
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Joey
Rachel|1| Come here
Rachel|1| Come here
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| What
Joey|3| What
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| You mean how they're friends and nothing more
Joey|3| 
Rachel|1| No
Rachel|1| Joey, she knows
Rachel|1| We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window
Rachel|1|  Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Yes, but y'know what
Joey|3| It doesn't matter who knows what
Joey|3| Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know
Joey|3| Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Wh-what do you mean
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| No-no-no
Joey|3| No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun
Joey|3| Telling them
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| I can't take any…
Phoebe|5| No
Phoebe|5| You don't have to do anything
Phoebe|5| Just don't tell them that we know
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Noo
Joey|3| I can't take any more secrets
Joey|3|  I've got your secrets
Joey|3| I've got their secrets
Joey|3| I got secrets of my own y'know
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| You don't have any secrets
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Oh yeah
Joey|3| Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal
Joey|3| 
Rachel|1|  So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Ugh
Joey|3|
Phoebe|5| Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Okay
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| And then
Phoebe|5| I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal
Phoebe|5| My sexuality
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4|  Hello children
Chandler|4|
All|0| Hey
All|0|
Phoebe|5| Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Hey

Chandler|4| Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things
Chandler|4|  Are you okay
Chandler|4|

Phoebe|5| I can't tell you this
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Phoebe, it's me
Chandler|4| You can tell me anything
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too
Phoebe|5| And the one person I want to the most
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| What's going on
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| I think it's just y'know that I haven't been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you're looking for something and you just don’t even see that it's right there in front of you sipping coffee—Oh no, have I said to much
Phoebe|5| Well it's just something to think about
Phoebe|5| I know I will
Phoebe|5|
Monica|2| You are so cute
Monica|2| How did you get to be so cute
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Okay, now you're even cuter
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| What
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| What are you talking about
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| That's not possible
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Ow
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| No, I didn't misunderstand, okay
Chandler|4| She was all over me
Chandler|4| She touched my bicep for crying out loud
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| This bicep
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Well it's not flexed right now
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Hey Mon, what are you doing now
Rachel|1| Wanna come see a movie with us
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry

Monica|2|
Phoebe|5| I have quarters
Phoebe|5| 
Ross|6|  Hey
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Hey Ross
Rachel|1| Any word on the apartment yet
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Oh
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| No-no, I got the edge
Ross|6| I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to 
Monica|2| Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it
Monica|2|
Ross|6| No
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| That new mountain bike
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| No
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Well what did you send
Monica|2|
Ross|6| A basket of mini-muffins
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets
Phoebe|5| Which one did you send
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| The small one
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Well yeah
Ross|6| Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins
Ross|6| It was the best day
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Your work makes me sad
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Oh man
Ross|6| I want that place so much
Ross|6|
Ross|6| I was so sure that was gonna work
Ross|6| There's twelve bucks I'll never see again
Ross|6| 
Rachel|1| All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Bye
Monica|2|
All|0| Bye
All|0|
Phoebe|5| Bye Chandler
Phoebe|5|   I miss you already
Phoebe|5| 
Chandler|4|  Okay, did you see that
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| With the inappropriate and the pinching
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Actually, I did
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Ohhh, oh my God
Monica|2| Oh my God
Monica|2| She knows about us
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Are you serious
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out
Monica|2| That's the only explanation for it
Monica|2|
Chandler|4|  Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps—She knows
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|  Joey
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Phoebe knows about us
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Well I didn't tell them
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Them
Monica|2|
Monica|2| Who's them
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Joey
Monica|2|
Joey|3| And Rachel
Joey|3| I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Oh man
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| I'm sorry
Joey|3| But hey, it's over now, right
Joey|3| Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Unless…
Joey|3| No
Joey|3| Not unless
Joey|3| Look this must end now
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us
Monica|2| But see they don't know that we know that they know
Monica|2| So…
Chandler|4| Ahh yes, the messers become the messies
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Noooo
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Y'know what you should do
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Huh
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1| Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches
Rachel|1| Or uh, or my underwear
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| I'm listening
Joey|3|
Rachel|1|  See
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| That is a great idea
Ross|6| And
Ross|6| I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge
Ross|6| Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| He broke that
Phoebe|5|
Ross|6| Well, he had gravity boots
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| Yeah, he broke those too
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| So he likes to break stuff
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out
Ross|6|  Hey, didn't he used to have a cat
Ross|6|
Phoebe|5| I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Right
Ross|6| 
Rachel|1| Hello
Rachel|1|  Oh yeah

Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| Really
Phoebe|5|
Chandler|4| Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep
Chandler|4| Or maybe more
Chandler|4|
Phoebe|5| I'll have to get back to you on that
Phoebe|5| Okay, bye
Phoebe|5|  Oh my God
Phoebe|5| He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more
Phoebe|5|
Rachel|1| Are you kidding

Phoebe|5| They're trying to mess with us
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5| They don't know that we know they know we know
Phoebe|5|  Joey, you can't say anything
Phoebe|5|
Joey|3| I couldn't even if I wanted too
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Good evening, sir
