Chandler|4|  Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again
Chandler|4| I think I can come up with something better than that
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge
Rachel|1|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, I should probably take it back
Phoebe|5| Ooh, but you know what
Phoebe|5| While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year

Monica|2| 
Joey|3|  What
Joey|3|
Joey|3| Why
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Monica|2| What is going on with you
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Nothing
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Oh, come on
Chandler|4| You've been acting strange all day
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| All right
Joey|3| There is something
Joey|3| I kinda had a dream,  but I don't want to talk about it
Joey|3| 
Chandler|4| Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that
Chandler|4|  I kinda have a dream
Chandler|4| I don’t want to talk about it
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Well, it involved Monica
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4| Oh, that is so cool
Chandler|4|  I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing
Chandler|4|   Anyway we're talking about your dream
Chandler|4|  I love you
Chandler|4|  Your dream
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3| Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything
Joey|3| I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish
Joey|3| 
Monica|2| What was the dream about
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Well, okay
Joey|3| You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle
Joey|3| Y'know like you guys were doing last night
Joey|3| So, that's it
Joey|3| I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Wait, Joey
Monica|2| Joey
Monica|2| That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love with me
Monica|2|
Joey|3| It-it doesn’t
Joey|3|
Monica|2| No
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| No, it can mean anything
Chandler|4| Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| That kinda sounds like your dream dude
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too
Monica|2|
Joey|3| In the dream I did enjoy the closeness
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Um-hmm
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica
Chandler|4| Right here, right now, are you attracted to her
Chandler|4|
Joey|3|  Not really
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Well there you have it
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Well sure
Monica|2| I'm just wearing sweats
Monica|2|  But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend
Monica|2|
Joey|3| No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend
Joey|3| Y'know
Joey|3| I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend
Joey|3| Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating
Chandler|4| So maybe-maybe that's it
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Friends first
Joey|3| That's interesting
Joey|3|
Monica|2| You become friends after
Monica|2|
Joey|3| No, never done that either
Joey|3|
Rachel|1|  Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom
Chandler|4|
Monica|2|  That's right
Monica|2|

Phoebe|5| Excuse me, is this your car
Phoebe|5|
Guy|0| Yeah
Guy|0|
Phoebe|5| Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance
Phoebe|5| 
Guy|0| Don't worry about it
Guy|0| It's not a problem
Guy|0|
Phoebe|5| Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop
Phoebe|5| 
Guy|0|  So am I
Guy|0|
Phoebe|5| Ohh, no
Phoebe|5|  Oh okay, so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere, 'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too
Phoebe|5| So, all right, keep up the good work
Phoebe|5| 10-4
Phoebe|5| 
Cop|0|  Hey, wait a second
Cop|0| So wait, what precinct are you with
Cop|0|
Phoebe|5| I-I'm with the umm, the 57th
Phoebe|5|
Cop|0| Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there
Cop|0|
Phoebe|5| I'm in vice
Phoebe|5| Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now
Phoebe|5| I'm a whore
Phoebe|5|
Cop|0| Who-who else is in vice up there
Cop|0|
Phoebe|5| Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz
Phoebe|5|
Cop|0| Sipowicz
Cop|0| No, I don't think so
Cop|0|
Phoebe|5| Yeah, big guy, kinda bald
Phoebe|5|
Cop|0| No, I don't know him
Cop|0|
Phoebe|5|  Don’t try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out
Phoebe|5| His umm, his partner just died
Phoebe|5|
Cop|0| Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss
Cop|0|
Phoebe|5| I-I sure will, take care
Phoebe|5| 
Cop|0|  Hey by the way, I'm sure Sipowicz is gonna be all right
Cop|0| I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good
Cop|0|  And where did you find my badge
Cop|0|
Phoebe|5| Oh
Phoebe|5| 
Rachel|1| Hey
Rachel|1| Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class
Joey|3| But y'know what
Joey|3| I guess I can blow that off,  for you
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Thanks
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something
Joey|3| Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| I know
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there
Joey|3| I'm thinking of getting me one of those
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| What's up Joe
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| …is because they were friends first
Joey|3| Y'know
Joey|3|" So I asked myself, ""Who are my friends"
Joey|3|""" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first"
Joey|3| So…
Rachel|1|  What are you saying
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| I'll treat you real nice
Joey|3| 
Rachel|1|  Yeah, well, y'know umm… No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date
Rachel|1| Don't hit on your existing friends
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Won't-won't that take longer
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1| Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Yeah
Joey|3| I understand
Joey|3| I understand
Joey|3|  Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Come here to me
Ross|6| No-no, you come here to me
Ross|6|
Rachel|1|  Hey Ross
Rachel|1| I brought reinforcements
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Oh great

Rachel|1|
Chandler|4|  Hey
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Chandler
Ross|6|
Ross|6| You brought Chandler
Ross|6|
Ross|6| The next best thing would be Monica
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so…
Ross|6| Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it
Ross|6|  Okay Rach,  that's you
Ross|6| That's the couch
Ross|6|  
Rachel|1| Whoa-oh, what's-what's that
Rachel|1| 
Ross|6| Oh, that's me

Rachel|1|
Ross|6| No
Ross|6| That's-that's my arm

Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore
Ross|6|
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1|
Ross|6| All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| I can't believe that didn't work
Ross|6|
Rachel|1| I know, me neither
Rachel|1| I mean, you had a sketch
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4| Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot
Chandler|4|

Chandler|4| What's she like
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Uhh, well, she's…really good in bed
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first
Monica|2|
Joey|3|  Well look, hey, it's all your fault
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| Why
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Joey|3| Well because you didn't give me advice
Joey|3| No
Joey|3| You gave me a pickup line
Joey|3| As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first
Joey|3| I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her
Joey|3|  And her roommate
Joey|3|
Monica|2| What about the closeness
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Closeness-shmoshness
Joey|3| There was three of us for crying out loud
Joey|3|
Joey|3|  All right

Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Ooh, I do

Phoebe|5|
Cop|0| Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job
Cop|0| I mean, you understand right
Cop|0|
Phoebe|5| Yep
Phoebe|5| As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool
Phoebe|5| A fool
Phoebe|5|
Cop|0| I don't like looking foolish
Cop|0| Y'know what
Cop|0| Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today
Cop|0| Maybe I came by and you weren't here
