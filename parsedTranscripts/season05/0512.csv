Phoebe|5| Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past
Phoebe|5| So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase
Phoebe|5|

Chandler|4| I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey
Chandler|4| And Doug wants us to play tennis with them
Chandler|4| He's never even talked to me outside of work
Chandler|4| Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club
Chandler|4|  Strip church
Chandler|4| Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Hey, I thought you already had one
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at…bigger rocks
Chandler|4|  Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet
Chandler|4|
Rachel|1| Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back

Doug|0| That oughta sweeten it up, huh
Doug|0| 
Monica|2|  How does that laugh not give you a headache
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Oh, you get used to it
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can
Monica|2| So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Oh
Chandler|4| 
Doug|0|  Uh, I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee
Doug|0| Y'know, I feel sorry for it if it ever got in a fight, it's not strong enough to defend itself
Doug|0|  Did you hear what I said Bing
Doug|0|
Chandler|4| What
Chandler|4|
Doug|0| The joke Bing
Doug|0| What's the matter with you
Doug|0|

Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Really
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Yeah
Monica|2| I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it
Monica|2| You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay
Monica|2| But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically
Monica|2| You get it now honey
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| I think I do
Chandler|4|  Thank you, Monica
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| I thought you could use the help
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| Coffee in a fight
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3|  Hey Rach

Joey|3| Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate
Joey|3|
Rachel|1| What
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1| She just called and said that she was gonna be working late
Rachel|1| She keeps lying to me
Rachel|1| That's it
Rachel|1| Y'know what
Rachel|1| I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now
Rachel|1|
Chandler|4|  All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| Sorry
Monica|2| I'm just—I'm not very good at this
Monica|2| I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel
Monica|2|
Chandler|4| But we're not ready to tell yet
Chandler|4|
Monica|2| I know
Monica|2| It's just that…ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too
Monica|2| Y'know
Monica|2| I miss that so much now
Monica|2| She's my best friend
Monica|2|
Monica|2|  Joey
Monica|2|
Monica|2| Oh my God, Rachel
Monica|2|

Monica|2|]
Rachel|1| Well, I was actually—I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp
Rachel|1| To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Okay great
Monica|2| 
Rachel|1| Yeah
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Great
Monica|2| Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it
Monica|2| In fact, he pays me to clean it
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Oh
Rachel|1| What a great way to earn some extra pocket money
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work

Ross|6| Thanks
Ross|6|
Janice|0| Actually, I should get going
Janice|0|
Ross|6| Are you sure
Ross|6| Because I can stay out as late as you want
Ross|6| I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right
Ross|6|
Janice|0| Yes
Janice|0| Yes
Janice|0| You did
Janice|0|
Ross|6| Oh…
Janice|0| What is wrong now
Janice|0|
Janice|0|
Ross|6| This isn't what I ordered
Ross|6| Man
Ross|6| Can anything go right in my life
Ross|6|
Ross|6| First my marriage falls apart and then…
Janice|0| I know
Janice|0| I know
Janice|0| And then you lose your apartment
Janice|0| And then you lose your job
Janice|0| And then your ex-wife gets married so fast
Janice|0| And now the coffee—ahh
Janice|0|
Janice|0| Ross, we need to talk
Janice|0|
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6| Sometimes I feel…
Janice|0| No-no-no, no
Janice|0| I'm going to talk
Janice|0| I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun
Janice|0|
Ross|6| Huh
Ross|6|
Janice|0|  You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining
Janice|0|
Janice|0|
Ross|6| Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney
Ross|6|  So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice
Ross|6|
Janice|0| Well yeah
Janice|0|
Janice|0|
Ross|6| OH…MY…GOD
Ross|6|
Ross|6|
Janice|0| Are you gonna be okay
Janice|0|
Ross|6| I am now
Ross|6|
Janice|0| Okay
Janice|0|
Joey|3| Umm, hi
Joey|3|
Janice|0| Oh hi
Janice|0| Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey
Janice|0| 
Ross|6| Dude, we got to talk
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice
Ross|6|  What you're-you're not mad
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Why would I be mad
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff
Ross|6| You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to
Ross|6|
Chandler|4|  I am mad
Chandler|4| But you know what I'm gonna do
Chandler|4| I'm gonna forgive you
Chandler|4| Because that's what friends do
Chandler|4| They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there
Chandler|4| Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Okay
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| All right
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty  seven dollars
Chandler|4| No strings attached
Chandler|4| Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down—let's write it down
Chandler|4|
