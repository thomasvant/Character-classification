Ross|6| I'm sorry, man
Ross|6| Hey, y'know what you should do
Ross|6| You should make something happen for yourself
Ross|6| Y'know, like-like write a play
Ross|6| Write a movie
Ross|6| Huh
Ross|6| I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Come on Ross be realistic, y'know
Joey|3| If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it
Joey|3|
Joey|3| Wait a second, I could star in it
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Or that
Ross|6|
Joey|3| I can't write
Joey|3| Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know
Joey|3| I can't do it
Joey|3|
Ross|6| I'll help you
Ross|6| Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it
Ross|6| And plus, it'll give me something to do
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Really
Joey|3| You'd-you'd do that for me
Joey|3|
Joey|3|
Ross|6| Yeah
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Thanks
Joey|3|
Ross|6|  All right, we'll start off slow

Ross|6|
Joey|3| Done
Joey|3|
Ross|6| And it can't be Joey
Ross|6|
Joey|3| It's not
Joey|3|

Ross|6|
Joey|3|  Oh
Joey|3|
Monica|2| Hey, what's up
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Oh, honey, I'm sorry
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Well, you should be, this is all your fault
Rachel|1| You meddled in our relationship
Rachel|1|
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| You had no relationship
Monica|2|
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Oh God, stop with the plan
Monica|2| So what, so what you saw him with a girl
Monica|2| Who cares
Monica|2|
Monica|2| That doesn't mean anything
Monica|2| Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| She was kinda stupid
Rachel|1| You're right
Rachel|1| All right, I'm just gonna go on the date
Rachel|1| I'm gonna go on the date
Rachel|1| That is the new plan
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Come on, hurry
Monica|2|
Joey|3| Hey, how do you spell suspicious
Joey|3| 
Chandler|4| Why
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Yes
Chandler|4| Chandler Bing, 7
Chandler|4| Chandler Bing, 0
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| You're driving me crazy with that
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Okay, I'll stop
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Don’t stop
Joey|3| Move the bowl further away
Joey|3| Ross could make that shot
Joey|3|
Joey|3| Well, you suck
Joey|3| But at least you suck at a man's game now
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| You wanna play
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon
Joey|3| And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home
Chandler|4|
Joey|3|  All right
Joey|3| But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| I'm intrigued
Chandler|4| 
Joey|3| All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid
Joey|3| 
Chandler|4| Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Uh yeah, right here
Joey|3| 
Phoebe|5| Thank you, Happy Holidays

Chandler|4| Op
Chandler|4| 
Ross|6| This is helping your career
Ross|6|
Ross|6| Huh

Ross|6|
Joey|3| You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work
Joey|3|
Ross|6|  And shame on you
Ross|6| You should know better, Joey needs to work

Phoebe|5| Sorry
Phoebe|5| 
Rachel|1|  Hey
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Hey
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something

Rachel|1|
Ross|6| Oh-oh, yeah
Ross|6|
Monica|2| All the time
Monica|2| In fact, I was undefeated
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Uh, you weighted 200 pounds
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Still, I was quick as a cat
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway
Rachel|1|
Monica|2| Oh, you're kidding
Monica|2|
Rachel|1| Yeah, they were very y'know…wrestley
Rachel|1| But, I guess that's normal
Rachel|1|
Monica|2|  We don't, we don't wrestle now
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Yeah, not since I got too strong for you
Ross|6|
Monica|2| Too strong for me
Monica|2|
Ross|6| Yeah
Ross|6|
Monica|2| You wanna go right now

Chandler|4| The puck drops in 20 minutes
Chandler|4| Come on, Joe
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Joey's not going
Ross|6|
Joey|3|  I didn't finish my five pages
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Well, why can't you do them tomorrow
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work
Joey|3|
Chandler|4|  Why don't you cut him a little slack
Chandler|4| Okay
Chandler|4| Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored
Chandler|4| Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| I am not unemployed
Ross|6| I'm on sabbatical
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Come on look guys, don't fight
Joey|3|
Ross|6| And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend
Ross|6| And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| If it does
Ross|6| Then you're an amazing friend of mine
Ross|6|
Joey|3| Hey-hey guys, hey
Joey|3| How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball
Joey|3| Huh
Joey|3| I'll go unhook the smoke detectors
Joey|3|
Ross|6| How about we settle this right now
Ross|6|  There
Ross|6| Now, no one's going to the game
Ross|6| Ha-ha-ha
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| I paid for those tickets
Chandler|4|
Ross|6| No you didn't
Ross|6| You said you would, but you never did
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Oh yeah
Chandler|4| 
Danny|0| …so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera
Danny|0|
Joey|3| Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| When did that happen to you
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture—I didn't have my camera
Joey|3|
Chandler|4| Oh yeah
Chandler|4| First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging
Chandler|4|
Krista|0| Oh, this is so good  you have got to try it
Krista|0| 
Danny|0| Oh, damn
Danny|0| I got it on my pants
Danny|0|
Krista|0| Here, I'll get it
Krista|0| 
Krista|0| We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set
Krista|0|
Danny|0| Yep
Danny|0|  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight
Danny|0|
Rachel|1| Oh, great
Rachel|1|

Phoebe|5| Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution
Phoebe|5|  And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too
Phoebe|5|  Hi Bob
Phoebe|5|   I thought I told you to get outta here
Phoebe|5|
Bob|0| Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot
Bob|0|
Phoebe|5| What
Phoebe|5|
Phoebe|5|
Bob|0| Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner
Bob|0|
Phoebe|5| That chick can't handle my corner
Phoebe|5|
Bob|0| Look, either you leave, or we remove you

Rachel|1|
Danny|0| What
Danny|0|
Danny|0| Why
Danny|0|
Danny|0|
Rachel|1| Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and…
Danny|0| Oh great
Danny|0| That special bond again
Danny|0| Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister
Danny|0|
Rachel|1| Well, okay, look
Rachel|1| I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's…
Danny|0| Do-do you, do you have brothers
Danny|0|
Rachel|1| No, I have two sisters
Rachel|1| But one of them has a very masculine energy
Rachel|1|
Danny|0| Are you close with them
Danny|0|
Rachel|1| No-no, they're not very nice people
Rachel|1|
Danny|0| Okay, listen, I really like you
Danny|0| Okay
Danny|0| I think this can go somewhere
Danny|0| So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us
Danny|0|
Rachel|1| Well, uh, I-I don't know
Rachel|1| See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of…

Danny|0|
Rachel|1| Yeah, okay, I'll see you later

Chandler|4|  Last night
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| No dude, Ross tore up the tickets
Joey|3|
Ross|6| I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus
Ross|6| Huh
Ross|6|
Chandler|4| Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY
Chandler|4|
Chandler|4|
Joey|3| Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it
Joey|3| And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it
