Chandler|Chandler|  Hello?  Hello?
Monica|Monica|  I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
Chandler|Chandler| Honey, you're screaming.
Monica|Monica| YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day    ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
Chandler|Chandler|  Oh, that's great.
Monica|Monica| Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean...    Monica clean.
Chandler|Chandler|  Awesome.
Monica|Monica| Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy,    Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt,    the funniest guy I have ever met. 
Mike|Other| This is nice.
Phoebe|Phoebe| I know! 
Mike|Other| You need both hands for that?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah, I kinda do.  Well,    how's this? 
Joey|Joey|  Aaahhh, look    at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious?  Have you not talked about it yet?     Am I making you uncomfortable?  If you were bigger you'd hit me,    huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh 
Phoebe|Phoebe| I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early    for us to be... having that conversation.
Mike|Other| Is it?
Phoebe|Phoebe|  Maybe not, is it?
Mike|Other| Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this    way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet    someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have    this...  No, not... that's gum.  Ooh, five bucks...    I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...
Phoebe|Phoebe|  I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?
Mike|Other| Oh, sorry. 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the    five dollars.
Mike|Other| It's to my apartment.
Phoebe|Phoebe|  Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for    Phoebe and Mike.
Mike|Other| Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have    to give me your key just because...
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh no, I want to.
Mike|Other| Oh, thank God. 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never    meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. 
Mike|Other| Is this cool, huh?
Phoebe|Phoebe| It really is.
Joey|Joey|  Oh, I know it... It    is amazing these little things open doors... huh! 
Rachel|Rachel| So I don't go back to work for another four weeks,    but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance    to know her.
Prospective nanny|Other|  I think that's    really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better. 
Rachel|Rachel| That's great, great. So do you have any questions    for us?
Prospective nanny|Other| Not really.
Rachel|Rachel| Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... 
Ross|Ross| Thank you.
Rachel|Rachel| Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.
Prospective nanny|Other| Oh, you know, wait. I do have    one question.  Do you guys do random drug    testing?
Ross|Ross| Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
Prospective nanny|Other| That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm    gonna need three days notice.
Rachel|Rachel| Okidoki!  Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.
Ross|Ross| Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews     And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider    the uhm... the first one we met with.
Rachel|Rachel|  What, the blonde with no bra?
Ross|Ross| She was blonde?  Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree    in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three    years.
Rachel|Rachel| Okay... 
Sandy|Other|  Hi... I'm Sandy.
Ross|Ross| And she's a little mannish...
Phoebe|Phoebe|  Oh my God! David!
David|Other| Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?
Phoebe|Phoebe|  No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW,    hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?
David|Other| Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to    explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that    we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Who cares, it got you here.
David|Other| Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got    on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your    address I... I... I didn't even think about it.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Wow. Where is your luggage? 
David|Other| Damn it!
Phoebe|Phoebe| A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.
David|Other| Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you    just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression,    uhm... it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that    means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at: wow!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually,    no, I look pretty good.
David|Other| Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see    someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and    you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful,    but... well, you are.  Well, so, uhm... are you seeing...    anyone? 
Phoebe|Phoebe| No...
Phoebe|Phoebe| I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How    can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
Monica|Monica| Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
Phoebe|Phoebe| He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...
Monica|Monica| Oh, well... That had been your window.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking,    I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's    here. He's just, he's so irresistible.
Monica|Monica| Really? The scientist guy?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Really? Chandler?
Monica|Monica| Continue...
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him    that I would see him tomorrow night.
Monica|Monica| Phoebe!
Phoebe|Phoebe| I know!  Evil! And... and... and...    I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!
Monica|Monica| Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the    same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
Phoebe|Phoebe|  Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given    my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.
Monica|Monica| What are you gonna do?
Phoebe|Phoebe| I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that    nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated    moral situation, no right, no wrong...
Monica|Monica| You have to tell David!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation    with Joey.
Chandler|Chandler|  Funniest guy she's ever met!     I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock    jokes...  Save it for    inside! 
Monica|Monica| Heeeeeey! 
Chandler|Chandler| Hey!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Hey!
Chandler|Chandler| So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they    call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state.  And what's with Oklahoma    having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from    the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.
Monica|Monica|  Was your cabin    pressurised?
Chandler|Chandler|  And don't get    me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Okay. 
Chandler|Chandler| What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two    words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so,    I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried    chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken?  See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?
Monica|Monica| No, it just remind me of something this guy did today    at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, he came up...
Monica|Monica| Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there,    but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. 
Chandler|Chandler|  Were you there?
Phoebe|Phoebe| No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
Sandy|Other| I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave    your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your    heart... 
Rachel|Rachel| Sandy, that's exactly what it is...
Ross|Ross| Are you gay? 
Rachel|Rachel| Ross!
Sandy|Other| It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I    am straight. I-I'm engaged actually.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh!
Sandy|Other| Her name is Deliah.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, that's pretty.
Ross|Ross|  So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
Sandy|Other| I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people,    but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is    take care of a child.
Ross|Ross|  Okay.
Sandy|Other| Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three    weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person...    When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy...  That was his name for me... I'll see you every day...    right in... 
Ross|Ross| Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. 
Rachel|Rachel| Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
Sandy|Other| Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, that would be great!  I love him, I love him, I love him...
Ross|Ross| Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
Rachel|Rachel| So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good    reason we shouldn't try him out.
Ross|Ross| Because, it's weird!
Rachel|Rachel| Why?
Ross|Ross| What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's    like if a woman wanted to be...
Rachel|Rachel|  Yes?
Ross|Ross| King?
Sandy|Other| I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made    lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that    rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young... 
Rachel|Rachel|  Please?  YES! Sandy you're hired.
Sandy|Other| That's great!  I'm    sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new    family...
Ross|Ross| You gotta be at least bi...
Chandler|Chandler| Hey!  I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica    is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
Joey|Joey| Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering    lines.
Chandler|Chandler|  Well, thank God your    livelihood doesn't depend on it.
Joey|Joey| I know, right?     Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
Chandler|Chandler| Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy    she's ever met.
Joey|Joey| Seriously? She actually said that?
Chandler|Chandler| Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
Joey|Joey| Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah!
Joey|Joey|" Without that, you just got ""lame with women""."
Chandler|Chandler| Ye.... 
Monica|Monica| Hi! There you are.
Joey|Joey|  Fire trucks! 
David|Other| Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oof...
David|Other| In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now. 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, wait, wait!
David|Other| Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that.    I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...
Phoebe|Phoebe| No, no, it's not that.     Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well,    uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.
David|Other| Oh... oh...
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah, I should have told you.
David|Other| No... well, yeah.
Phoebe|Phoebe| I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
David|Other| Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well,    are you happy with this guy?
Phoebe|Phoebe| I am happy.
David|Other| Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want    you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares,    leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I    should probably uhm... go...
Phoebe|Phoebe| Well... but David, just... I just want you to know    that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things    I've ever had to do.
David|Other| Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly    a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss    on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...
David|Other| No... no...
Phoebe|Phoebe| I mean... 
David|Other| In Minsk...
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah?
David|Other| ...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm...    and one on the lips.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Well, if that's what they do in Minsk...  In New York...    it's... 
Rachel|Rachel|  Oh... Oh boy...  Hi...
Ross|Ross|  Is everything allright?
Rachel|Rachel| Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was    just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just    sooo beautiful.
Sandy|Other| Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the    poem...
Rachel|Rachel| I can't... I can't hear it again.
Sandy|Other| You know, I can't tell it again... 
Ross|Ross| And I'm fine never having heard it...  Rach, can I... can I see    you for a sec?
Rachel|Rachel| Yeah!  Excuse me... 
Ross|Ross| Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three    times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
Rachel|Rachel| Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive,    that's all.
Ross|Ross|  Okay, okay, see... that... that    is the problem. He is too sensitive. 
Rachel|Rachel| What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
Ross|Ross|  Yeah, I mean, all things    that guy...  These are amazing!
Rachel|Rachel| Sandy made Madeleines.
Ross|Ross| This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What    kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even...    butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. 
Rachel|Rachel| Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say...    I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men.    You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in    from branding cattle.
Ross|Ross| Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
Rachel|Rachel| Okay, what? What is too sensitive? 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.
David|Other| But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and    good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.
Phoebe|Phoebe| No, no. No.
David|Other| But... ergo...
Phoebe|Phoebe| Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah,    we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with    Mike and I really care about him...
David|Other| Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul...    ui... 
Mike|Other| Well... hey, the key works...! 
Phoebe|Phoebe|  And you thanks for the    face massage. Thank you.
Ross|Ross| Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
Monica|Monica| Yeah! I think that's great!
Ross|Ross| Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites    poetry and bakes Madeleines?
Monica|Monica| Oh... How are they?
Ross|Ross|  Lighter than air...  But that's not the point. 
Joey|Joey| Hey!
Ross|Ross| Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Joey|Joey|  Really...? Guys do that...? That's...    weird...
Ross|Ross| Thank you!
Joey|Joey| That's like a woman wanting to be a...
Ross|Ross| ...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?
Monica|Monica| Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
Joey|Joey| Uhm... A penis model.  Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler    that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
Monica|Monica| Yeah, so?
Ross|Ross| Wow!
Joey|Joey| Really? Do you not know Chandler?
Monica|Monica| Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...?    Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
Joey|Joey| So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing...    You know, like Ross's thing is... 
Ross|Ross| Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?
Joey|Joey| ...No... 
Monica|Monica| I can't believe he's that upset about this...
Joey|Joey| Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay.    'Cause he's feeling like... 
Chandler|Chandler| Hey!
Joey|Joey| Heeeyy! Hey!
Chandler|Chandler| What are you guys talking about?
Ross|Ross| Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. 
Chandler|Chandler| You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?    
Chandler|Chandler| You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do    draw the line at a male wetnurse. 
Monica|Monica| Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
Chandler|Chandler| If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would    have brought more pizza. 
Monica|Monica| Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! 
Chandler|Chandler| What is so funny about that? 
Monica|Monica| Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say    it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!    
Chandler|Chandler| Did you tell her what we talked about? 
Joey|Joey| Yeah....
Chandler|Chandler| So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? 
Monica|Monica| Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with    Geoffrey.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
Monica|Monica| Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean,    you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions...    and... and limericks...
Chandler|Chandler| I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named    Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
Monica|Monica| Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on,    you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the    girl with the lazy eye...?  That slayed me.
Ross|Ross| Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! 
Joey|Joey| Not knowing when to shut up...
Ross|Ross| Yep! That's my thing...
Mike|Other| So... how many guys have your key?
Phoebe|Phoebe| No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts    not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
Mike|Other| Your lipstick's on his mouth.
David|Other| Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.
Phoebe|Phoebe| No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years    ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.
Mike|Other| Did you uhm...
Phoebe|Phoebe| No, no... 
Mike|Other| ...kiss him?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, well, yeah...
David|Other| Yes, but uhm... You should know... she really likes    you. I-In fact I-I-I don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella.    
Mike|Other| Don't point your finger at me.
David|Other| Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?
Mike|Other| Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about    it... 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt!     Here David, you    should just go.
David|Other| Allright... But... if I ever do come back    from Minsk...  well, you just better watch out.
Mike|Other| Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd    better watch out.
David|Other| Oh, you're going to Minsk?
Mike|Other| Well, I might.
David|Other| Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just    lovely there.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Okay, well... guys?
David|Other| Right... Goodbye Phoebe. 
Mike|Other| Hey, what are you kidding me?
David|Other| Right-o, right-o...  Take good care of her.    
Phoebe|Phoebe| I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your    key back, I totally understand.
Mike|Other| It's never gonna happen again right?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Right! Never! Never! I swear! 
David|Other| I-I... Oh I...I just wanna say uhm... if you do ever    come to Minsk, that's my number  We'll uhm... we'll    party up Vladnik style. 
Joey|Joey| Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught    me Hot-cross Buns.
Ross|Ross| Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
Joey|Joey| Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... 
Ross|Ross|  I swear to    God...! 
Sandy|Other| Who's up for puppets?
Joey|Joey| Me! I'm up for puppets!
Sandy|Other| Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants    to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?
Ross|Ross| Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed    to appreciate puppets?
Sandy|Other| Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours    help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us.    
Joey|Joey| I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. 
Ross|Ross|  Oh my God!
Sandy|Other| Well, I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus...    
Rachel|Rachel| That was kind of rude!
Ross|Ross| Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps    for me.
Rachel|Rachel| You know, he was just doing his job...
Ross|Ross| Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one    who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I    can't go through with this.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, come on Ross...
Ross|Ross| No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force    you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
Rachel|Rachel|  Oh... That's true.
Ross|Ross| Thank you!
Rachel|Rachel| Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're    gonna have to do it. 
Sandy|Other|  So you see Wigglemunch, that's    why it's important to shaaaaaaare...
Joey|Joey|  I am learning so much from you.
Chandler|Chandler| Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend    has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.
Monica|Monica| Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey    told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
Chandler|Chandler| Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep    it smart, people!
Monica|Monica| Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.
Chandler|Chandler| I love you too.  And... I like you as a friend.  
Joey|Joey| Allright. See you later!
Chandler|Chandler| See ya! 
Joey|Joey|  Did that guy really make that joke?
Monica|Monica| Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing    so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.
Ross|Ross| Here goes...
Rachel|Rachel| I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. 
Ross|Ross| Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid    it's not working out.
Sandy|Other|  Oh...
Ross|Ross| Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great...    with Emma... uhm... We just feel...
Rachel|Rachel|  YOU! You feel!
Ross|Ross| I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right.    I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...
Sandy|Other| Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers    from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.
Rachel|Rachel|  Oh, damn you Geller!
Ross|Ross| Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
Sandy|Other| No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever    is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem?    Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.
Ross|Ross| No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's    uhm... my issue.
Sandy|Other| What is it...?  Please...? 
Ross|Ross| You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with    a guy who's as sensitive as you.
Sandy|Other| That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think    that is?
Ross|Ross| Why... I... I don't know.     Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?
Sandy|Other| hmmm... 
Ross|Ross| I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was    kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.
Rachel|Rachel|  Huh ha ha!
Ross|Ross| I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get    the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
Sandy|Other| That must have been hard.
Ross|Ross|" It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom...    playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father    walks in and says... he says... ""What are you doing with those things?    What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like    a... like a real boy?"
Sandy|Other| But you are a real boy!
Ross|Ross| I know I am!  ...And when it's    summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?
Sandy|Other| It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos    out. 
Ross|Ross| Here come some more...
Sandy/Grumpus|Other| And what's the one kind of boat that can never,    ever sink?
Joey/Wigglemunch|Other| What kind?
Sandy/Grumpus|Other| A friend-ship...
Joey|Joey| Wow! You blow my mind...
Sandy|Other| Oh, I gotta go.
Joey|Joey| Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
Sandy|Other| Twenty bucks.
Joey|Joey| It's like the cheapest college ever.
