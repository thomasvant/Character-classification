Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh hey you guys, I couldn’t get a reservation for the night of  my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.
Joey|Joey| Thursday? But that’s Halloween.
Phoebe|Phoebe| So?
Joey|Joey|  So spooky, that’s all.
Ross|Ross| So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?
Phoebe|Phoebe| No! It’s my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to  work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think it’s a little to soon to show my true  colors.
Rachel|Rachel| Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us  has to stay home and watch Emma.  Which one of us should go to  dinner?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, Rachel!
Ross|Ross| Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, yay!
Ross|Ross| Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you  know what? We all haven’t been together the six of us in such a long time.
Monica|Monica| What are you talking about? We’re all together right now.
Rachel|Rachel| Um, Mon, Chandler’s not here.
Monica|Monica| Oh, dear god!
Chandler|Chandler| Good morning everyone, it’s nice to see our team together  for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions?   Yes, Ken is it?
Ken|Other| That’s right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsa  is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you  were saying yes to?
Chandler|Chandler|  Well, don’t believe everything you hear, Ken.  But yeah, that’s true. Alright, let’s get started, by  take a look at last quarter’s figures.  Ah, Claudia, aren’t you supposed to blow smoke up the  bosses’ ass?
Claudia|Other| I’m sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
Chandler|Chandler| No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right  now, I can’t remember why.  You’re not allowed to smoke in this  office. Not right?
Claudia|Other| Yes, in Oklahoma it’s legal to smoke in offices with fifteen  people or less.  Would you like one?
Chandler|Chandler| Alright, lo…look. I don’t smoke anymore. But if the rest of  you want to light up, go ahead, it’s fine.  So you all smoke  then? That’s almost rude, that I’m not.
Ken|Other| That’s not true. If you don’t wanna smoke …
Chandler|Chandler|  Ken, please! No, I can’t, I can’t smoke. If I smoke,  my wife would kill me.
Ken|Other| I’m sorry, but isn’t your wife back in New York?
Chandler|Chandler| I always liked you, Ken. 
Phoebe|Phoebe|  Trick or treat! 
Monica|Monica|  Hey!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Ooh, and treat it is. 
Monica|Monica| Hmhmm. 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that can’t  contain my breasts.
Monica|Monica| This is not, what I’m wearing. I’m ovulating and Chandler’s  gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Ohh. Oh wait!  you guys won’t be late for my dinner, will  you?
Monica|Monica| Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a  week. We’ll probably be the first ones there.
Phoebe|Phoebe| ’kay, see you there. Happy humping!  Hey…hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don’t people  know, you’re not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
Chandler|Chandler| Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas  and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
Phoebe|Phoebe| You smoked!
Chandler|Chandler| No! I just happened t’do a lot trivias about smoking in  different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called  Leyhallalookoos.
Phoebe|Phoebe|  Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.
Chandler|Chandler| Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound … and  the breasts of a Greek goddess.
Chandler|Chandler| Pheebs?
Phoebe|Phoebe|  I’m gonna go. 
Chandler|Chandler|  Okay, something to cover the smell … Oven  cleaner!  Unscented!
Monica|Monica|  Welcome home. I’ve missed you. join me in  the bedroom?
Chandler|Chandler| No thanks, I’m good.
Monica|Monica|  O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?
Chandler|Chandler|  Right. You know what? Actually I just get off  the plane, so I’m feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
Monica|Monica| You don’t need a shower.
Chandler|Chandler|  Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself  during some turbulences.
Monica|Monica| What do I smell?  I smell smoke. Huh—did you  smoke?
Chandler|Chandler| Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay,  five. A pack. Two pack…a…a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days.   But it’s over, I made a decision, I’m not gonna smoke anymore.
Monica|Monica| 
Chandler|Chandler| But, those are for you.
Ross|Ross| Alright, we’ll just, uh, see when you get here. Bye.   Huh, that was my mom, she’s stuck in terrible traffic.
Rachel|Rachel| Okay, well that’s now the third sign that I should not leave  Emma.
Ross|Ross| Oh, what were the other two?
Rachel|Rachel| Well, let’s see. The first one is: I don’t want to. And, you  know, I’m not going.
Ross|Ross| I know, it’s the first time, we’re leaving the baby and … hey, I  know how hard it is for you, but … but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be  with her. She’s great with kids.
Rachel|Rachel| She is?
Ross|Ross| Ya.
Rachel|Rachel| What about  Monica.
Ross|Ross| Hey, you only heard Monica’s side of that. That little fatso was  a terror.
Rachel|Rachel| Ish. I just don’t think I can bear it.
Ross|Ross| Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.
Rachel|Rachel| Uch.
Ross|Ross| Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don’t you, why  don’t you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I’ll  meet you there.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh-A.
Ross|Ross| No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the  world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red. 
Rachel|Rachel| You need to learn some new slang.
Ross|Ross| I’m serious. C’mon, you should go. Here.  No, uh-uh, just go.
Rachel|Rachel| What … Oh! 
Ross|Ross| No! No, you know what?  You  , the baby’s fine, now squam . Yeah,  story  walking. 
Rachel|Rachel| I was just going to say that I left my keys.
Ross|Ross| Oh,  holy molly are we in a pickle now.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Where is everyone? They’re forty minutes late.
Joey|Joey| I know, u-uch.
Phoebe|Phoebe| I’m starving. I know we were coming here tonight, I ate  nothing all day.
Joey|Joey| What about me, he? Only had one lunch today.
Waiter|Other|  Soo, are we expecting the rest of our  party shortly?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival  is in the offing.
Waiter|Other| Right. We do have a table for two available, perhaps you would  be more comfortable.
Joey|Joey| No, they’re comin’, we’re waitin’ right here.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Joseph!  Thou needn’t worry, they shan’t be  long.
Waiter|Other| It’s just that we do have some large parties waiting.
Phoebe|Phoebe| One really does have a stick up one’s ass. Doesn’t one?
Monica|Monica| How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad  with a little kid walks to grandpa, it’s chilling.
Chandler|Chandler| I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.
Monica|Monica| So what? Don’t you have any will power?
Chandler|Chandler| Will power? I’ve watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs   without taking the tin foil off.
Monica|Monica| You said that was sexy!
Chandler|Chandler| ’kay, look: Can we just drop this? I’m not gonna smoke  again.
Monica|Monica| That’s right, because I forbid you to smoke again.
Chandler|Chandler| You forbid me?
Monica|Monica| Mhmm.
Chandler|Chandler| You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she  here by the way?
Monica|Monica| Don’t joke  with me, okay? I’m very, very upset right  now.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?
Monica|Monica| Yes.
Chandler|Chandler| Then, I might as well …  do this  . Not really sure what to do now.
Monica|Monica| Well, I’ll tell you what we’re gonna do: We are already late  for Phoebe’s birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, we’re  gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex.
Chandler|Chandler| Fine. What!?
Monica|Monica| Sex! This is the last day I’m ovulating, and when we don’t do  it now, we’ll have to wait till next month. 
Chandler|Chandler| You serious? 
Monica|Monica| Oh yeah!
Chandler|Chandler| Right, fine, I’ll do it, but no talking.
Monica|Monica| Huh, and no cuddling.
Chandler|Chandler| And no kissing your neck.
Monica|Monica| Oh good, I hate it when you do that
Chandler|Chandler| And lots of kissing your neck.
Ross|Ross| Okay, well the ??? is not home.
Rachel|Rachel| No. Uch.
Ross|Ross| Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has  the keys.
Rachel|Rachel| Alright, I can’t, I can’t wait that long. You have to do  something—knock that door down!
Ross|Ross| I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y…you know,  everything is gonna be fine. The baby’s sleeping.
Rachel|Rachel| What if she jumped out the bassinet?
Ross|Ross| Can’t hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh my god, I left the water running.
Ross|Ross| Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull  yourself together, okay?
Rachel|Rachel| Ah, did I leave the stove on?
Ross|Ross| You never cooked since 1996. 
Rachel|Rachel| Is the window open? Because if there’s a window open, a bird  could fly in there.
Ross|Ross| Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you’re right. I think …  listen, listen!
Rachel|Rachel| Ubb.
Ross|Ross| A pigeon, a pigeon.  No, no  wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby,  seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird’s aid. The eagle,  however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon.  Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays   are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the  apartment.
Rachel|Rachel| Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that’s true.
Waiter|Other| Hello.
Phoebe & Joey|Other| Hey.
Waiter|Other| It’s been an hour. ??? be willing to reconsider switching to a  smaller table.
Joey|Joey| Maybe we should just eat now.
Waiter|Other| You can’t order until your entire party has arrived.  Restaurant policy.
Joey|Joey| Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there’s  still some food left on their place, okay, what’s the restaurant’s policy about  people eatin’ that?
Waiter|Other| Estrangement .
Joey|Joey| But it happens?  I’m gotta go to the  bathroom.
Phoebe|Phoebe| No, you can’t go. No-no-no, I can’t hold this table on my own.  If they ask me to move, I cave.
Joey|Joey| If you ask me to stay, I’ll pee. 
Maitre D’|Other| Good evening, Miss.  Miss?   Miss?  Miss!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Okay, fine, I’ll move. Alright, you don’t have to manhandle  me.  Where?  Okay. Thank you. Wach.
Joey|Joey|  Finally you guys made it.   Pheebs, who the hell—uhuhh!
Monica|Monica| Spend more time with the tie. That’ll make a baby.
Chandler|Chandler| Look, I can’t do this. I can’t make luv to you while we’re  fighting this way.
Monica|Monica| Oh sure, now you’re Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to  have sex right after my uncle’s funeral
Chandler|Chandler| That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I’m not gonna  do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
Monica|Monica| No, you’re right. Mnya, we shouldn’t do it like this. Huch.  For what it’s worth, I’m, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have come down on you so hard  about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.
Chandler|Chandler| Mean it?
Monica|Monica| Yah.
Chandler|Chandler| You are incredible. Unless, I…I’m not gonna smoke again. And  if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you. 
Monica|Monica| D’you want to?
Chandler|Chandler| Yeah, let’s celebrate life!
Monica|Monica| ’kay.
Rachel|Rachel| Och, god.  Oh, thank god, you’re okay. I’m so  sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again.  Uch.
Ross|Ross| Great. So let’s get going?
Rachel|Rachel| Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I’m never leaving  her again.
Ms. Geller|Other| I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to  leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his  clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out: “Mommy, I’m a girl, take  me with you.”
Ross|Ross| Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
Chandler|Chandler| Uhh. You are welcome.
Monica|Monica| You know what? Let’s not talk.
Chandler|Chandler| What?
Monica|Monica| Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
Chandler|Chandler| But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of  cigarettes—no big deal.
Monica|Monica| Oh, blablablabaybaybay.
Chandler|Chandler| Leave it.
Monica|Monica| I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said  you wouldn’t have sex with me while we’re fighting.
Chandler|Chandler| You tricked me to get me into bed?
Monica|Monica| That’s right, I got mine.
Chandler|Chandler| I feel so used.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Well, I guess they’re not coming. You wanna just order?
Joey|Joey| Thank you.  Waiter! ’lright,  this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up: Risotto with the shaped truffles and  the roasted rip steak with the golden Chanterelles and a Bordelaise sauce and  that any that stuff I just said means snails. 
Waiter|Other| Er—does not.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?
Waiter|Other| Oh, they’re both exclus…
Phoebe|Phoebe| Both it is, thank you.
Joey|Joey| Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring  everything as soon as it’s ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don’t care.
Ross & Rachel|Other|  Hey, hi, hi!
Waiter|Other| I’ll just wait to put your order in.
Phoebe|Phoebe| You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?
Ross|Ross| I’m so sorry …
Rachel|Rachel| We got locked out of the apartment, we …
Joey|Joey| That’s a great story—can I eat it?
Ross|Ross| And then Rachel wasn’t sure she could leave the baby.
Rachel|Rachel| N-it wasn’t easy, but it’s your birthday and I did what I got  to do.
Phoebe|Phoebe| And that’s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
Rachel|Rachel| Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I’m not distracted,  worrying about Emma, how she’s doing at home and I’m being completely here with  you and, oh, she spit up!
Ross|Ross| What?
Rachel|Rachel| She spit up. Judy! She spi…Judy! Look alive, Judy!  Thank you.
Ross|Ross| Thanks. Oh.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave?  What should I have?
Joey|Joey|  Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
Ross|Ross| Y’know this ??? is incredible.
Joey|Joey| Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
Ross|Ross| Okay, I’ll have the fixed salad and the duck.
Rachel|Rachel| Yah, I’ll have the soup and the salmon.
Joey|Joey| And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because  …
Monica|Monica|  Happy birthday!
Joey|Joey| Son of a bitch!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Wher-where have you been?
Monica|Monica| Well, we had a little fight.
Chandler|Chandler| I would never lie to get someone into bed.
Monica|Monica| You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy.   Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn’t it? How d’you get a bigger table?  You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo,  I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.
Chandler|Chandler| I suppose that Monica will have the … manipulative  shrew.
Waiter|Other| I’ll give you another minute.
Joey|Joey| Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew! 
Ross|Ross| Rach, c’mon, Emma is fine. You’re turning into an obsessive  mother. Okay, you need to stop.
Rachel|Rachel| Y’guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the  beauty salon?
Chandler|Chandler| You mean the lully story?
Ross|Ross|  Huh-huh, they already know it.
Phoebe|Phoebe| You guys, we’ve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe  you should order.
Joey|Joey|  No, no, it’s okay, I already told the waiter what  they want.
Monica|Monica| Why would you do that?
Joey|Joey| Chandler, control your woman!
Rachel|Rachel|  Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would  like to start the celebration and make a toast … to Phoebe. She dropped her  sock.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Aw … what?
Rachel|Rachel| N-no, Emma dropped her sock.
Monica|Monica| Mom’s here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me  she was out of town.
Rachel|Rachel| Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby’s sock is on the  ground.
Phoebe|Phoebe| ’s a good toast.
Rachel|Rachel|  Could you please get her attention?
Ross|Ross| W-oa … Mommy! 
Phoebe|Phoebe|  Oh, for god’s sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick  up the sock! Pick up the sock!  I’m sorry, was that rude?  Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt  the hideousness  that is this  evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was  have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you  didn’t even have the courtesy to call.  Well, it’s too late  now.
Ross|Ross| Well, ??? think that’s us?
Phoebe|Phoebe| well, this is, this is, this is not over!   Hello?
Joey|Joey|  Well, what is going on with you  two?
Monica|Monica| Uch, you see, I’m ovulating.
Chandler|Chandler| Oh yeah, that’s what she says. But maybe you’re not  ovulating at all, maybe it’s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
Monica|Monica| Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can’t get enough.
Chandler|Chandler|  You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked  me into having sex with her.
Joey|Joey| So? Did have sex, right?
Chandler|Chandler| What’s the matter with me? Why I’m such a girl?
Phoebe|Phoebe|  Okay, that was Mike.
Rachel|Rachel| Phoebe, hi, we’re so sorry. You’re totally right. We are here  one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday  celebration.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, I’m gonna  take off.
Rachel|Rachel| What?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait.  Wait, I’m not t—not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with  her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh thank god, if Phoebe’s going, can we please take Emma  home?
Ross|Ross| You know, I think that’s a good idea—our babysitter just pounded  in another Chardonnet.  Bye, y’guys.
Monica|Monica| Bye.
Joey|Joey| See ya. Well, this is just us.
Monica & Chandler|Other| Mhum.
Monica|Monica| So, I’m, I’m probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it  another try?
Chandler|Chandler| So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?
Joey|Joey| Do, do you gonna do it now?
Monica|Monica| We don’t have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct  …
Joey|Joey| No-ohoh. 
Maitre D’|Other| I sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning.
Joey|Joey| Nah, just me. All alone.  Dinner for six  for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special.
Waiter|Other| How was everything, sir?
Joey|Joey| Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.
Waiter|Other| Well, I hope, you got some room left.
Waiters|Other|  Happy birthday to you, happy  birthday to you, happy birthday dear …
Joey|Joey| Joey! Joey.
Waiters|Other| … Joey, happy birthday to you.
Joey|Joey| That’s the best birthday ever.
