RACHEL| Oh well, well thank you.  Okay,    stop. Stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened,  that happened. 
ROSS| I don't know. But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.    He plays piano; I played keyboards in college. He's been divorced; I have some    experience in that area.
PHOEBE| I know. That was fun.
