Monica|Monica|: what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe   you were having an off night
Joey|Joey| HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes   when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN   MOST!
Monica|Monica|: Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her   out again.
Rachel|Rachel| yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember   who you've slept with, you're made for each other.
Joey|Joey| Interesting. all right I'll go out with her again   and try to get past it  OH SALT BLOATY!
Monica|Monica|: Joey, Joey.

Phoebe|Phoebe| What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!
Ross|Ross| oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there   to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended   up telling him that.
Phoebe|Phoebe| WHAT!
Ross|Ross| umm. that you had a six year long relationship with   a guy named Vicrum.
Phoebe|Phoebe| WHAT! WHY?
Ross|Ross| well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in   a serious relationship.
Phoebe|Phoebe|  If you hadn't just had a baby   with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your   danglers RIGHT NOW!
Ross|Ross| well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know   a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer  and he   used to date Oprah. 
Phoebe|Phoebe| I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross,   No I'm just gonna be honest with him.
Ross|Ross| Good yeah just be honest with him.
Phoebe|Phoebe| yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't   been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a   real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will   and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll   be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh   
Ross|Ross| I'll get it
Phoebe|Phoebe| ok
Mike|Other|  You know I'm trying to think   of the last time I opened a door and you weren't there, Phoebe are you ok?   
Phoebe|Phoebe| Uh huh yeah  there's just something umm,   there's something you should know  Vicrum just called.
 Hayley|Other| so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents,   a perfect couple getting divorced, I kinda took it the hardest cause I was   the youngest.
Joey|Joey| Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?
 Hayley|Other| What?
Joey|Joey| How could you not remember that we slept together?
 Hayley|Other| What! When?
Joey|Joey| I dunno!
 Hayley|Other| I really, really think I would remember sleeping with you
Joey|Joey| come on, come on, search your brain all right. it   was  a certain amount of time ago, I was here you were here, we had   sex  here, here, here NOT there. Anything?
 Hayley|Other| no it's not ringing any bells.
Joey|Joey| my god woman! How many people do you have to had been   with not to remember any of this?
 Hayley's roommate|Other| Hey Hayley you've really gotta fix that doorknob. Joey!
Joey|Joey| Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember   me Hey! I still got it.  so were good.  I'll let myself out.
Phoebe|Phoebe| .and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time   you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.
Mike|Other| But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross
Phoebe|Phoebe| yeah well  yeah you know Emma's birth certificate   might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.
Mike|Other| that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.
Phoebe|Phoebe| I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You   know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.
Mike|Other| I just think there's somebody better out there for   you,  I mean I'm not saying me but. maybe me.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh.
Mike|Other| and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with   me. although I do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway I just   think I can make you happy.
Phoebe|Phoebe| ok I can't do this.
Mike|Other| what's wrong?
Phoebe|Phoebe| well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because   I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with   a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so.  if that's   too weird for you and you wanna leave I totally understand. In fact I'll close   my eye's make it less awkward  You kissed me.
Mike|Other| uh huh
Phoebe|Phoebe| so you don't think I'm a total freak
Mike|Other| No. well look can I think your weird and also cool   for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you.
Phoebe|Phoebe| I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you   kiss me and also wanna kiss you again  and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.
Mike|Other| Definitely
Ross|Ross|  This is Vicrum.
Chandler|Chandler| Hi honey I'm home!
Monica|Monica|: Hi, how was your flight? 
Chandler|Chandler| oh it was great.
Monica|Monica|: Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable   because I.  have   a little surprise for you.
Chandler|Chandler| well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because   it's six o clock IN NY.C!
Monica|Monica|: Ok  This is how much I love   you. 
Chandler|Chandler|  Honey why am I watching   a bunch of sharks swimming around.
Monica|Monica|: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast   forward to something a little toothier.
Chandler|Chandler| no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie   that's all.
Monica|Monica|: Oh well this is the only one they had at our video   store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always   have to be sharks?
Chandler|Chandler| does what always have to be sharks.
Monica|Monica|: Honey look we can do something else, do you want   me to get into the tub and thrash.
Chandler|Chandler| What's going on?
Monica|Monica|: sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a   part of this.
Chandler|Chandler| let ME be a part of this!
Monica|Monica|: I saw what you were doing in Tulsa. angry sharks   turn you on!
Chandler|Chandler| no they don't
Monica|Monica|: then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF   a treat.
Chandler|Chandler| OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel,   I was just watching regular porn
Monica|Monica|: really?
Chandler|Chandler| yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American   action.
Monica|Monica|: I cannot tell you how happy that makes me! 
Chandler|Chandler| You are an amazing wife.  No really   you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you   find the strength and understanding over something like that.
Monica|Monica|: Im very, very drunk right now.
Joey|Joey|  see ordinarily I would talk   to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with   her?
 Phoebe|Other| you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your     whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious     relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you     go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience     never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.
Joey|Joey| your right! I love my life!  I actually did sleep with   her.
