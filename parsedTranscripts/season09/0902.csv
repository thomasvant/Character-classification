Ross|Ross| You said you’d marry Joey?
Rachel|Rachel| Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married!  I’m not helping.
Ross|Ross| So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?
Rachel|Rachel| That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
Ross|Ross| So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.
Rachel|Rachel| Well—Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
Ross|Ross| Well, Chandler’s my oldest friend, but Joey’s my—No! Ah! 
Rachel|Rachel| Ooooo!
Joey|Joey|  Hey you guys I’m gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.
Ross|Ross| Rachel said she’d marry you?!
Joey|Joey|  This isn’t the right room, sorry folks. 
Monica|Monica| Ok, I don’t wanna be negative so I’ll say that most of the signs you bought are good.
Phoebe|Phoebe|" No they ran out of ""It’s a girl"" but I can fix this one,  See?"
Monica|Monica|  So sexy.  Honey.
Chandler|Chandler| Yea yea. 
Monica|Monica| Honey why don’t you go lie down.
Chandler|Chandler| No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office  Am I producing them?
Joey|Joey| Why’re you so tired?
Chandler|Chandler| Couldn’t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn’t sleep. Y’know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I’ll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I’ll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn’t fall asleep.
Joey|Joey| You know what you should’ve done, you should have told yourself that little story.
Rachel|Rachel|  Hi!
Everyone|Other| Hi, welcome home!
Monica|Monica| Phoebe did the signs!
Rachel|Rachel| Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Look at all the stuff people sent!
Rachel|Rachel| Oh Ah!  Oh my gosh there’s something every mother needs, a giant stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment! What are people think…  Oh you guys I love it.
Joey|Joey| Hey so where’s Ross?
Rachel|Rachel| He’s downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
Joey|Joey| Is he still mad at us?
Rachel|Rachel| Well, you more then me, but he can’t stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.
Joey|Joey| That’s not fair! I can’t do that.
Rachel|Rachel| Yeah, I’m not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
Joey|Joey| See this is what I was afraid of, I didn’t think I should be here either but somebody  said he’d be over it by now.
Chandler|Chandler| Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
Ms. McKenna|Other| The numbers we are seeing New York, Chicago, and London are consistently solid, but many of our officers have reported disappointing fields.
Ms. McKenna|Other| Boston is down, Atlanta is down, Houston is down, I could go on and on but instead of boring you I’ll go straight to my forty two point plan.
Chandler|Chandler| Walter .
Phoebe|Phoebe| She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.
Monica|Monica| Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
Ross|Ross|  Okay I put most of the stuff away.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh great, the pacifiers?
Ross|Ross| In the closet.
Rachel|Rachel| The burping clogs?
Ross|Ross| Linen closet.
Rachel|Rachel| The diapers?
Ross|Ross| In the hospital.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Wow you guys got a hospital? Fancy!
Ross|Ross| No I left the diapers at the hospital! There’s some in the bag but I’ll run out and get some more.
Rachel|Rachel| Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
Ross|Ross| Sure what kind?
Rachel|Rachel| Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...
Ross|Ross| Please take your time, it’s an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
Rachel|Rachel| Blueberry.
Ross|Ross| Blueberry it is.
Rachel|Rachel| Thanks.
Monica|Monica| Wow, he’s really not letting this go, is he?
Rachel|Rachel| God how long do you think that’s gonna last?
Phoebe|Phoebe|" I dunno, well he got over the ""We were on a break"" thing really quickly."
Rachel|Rachel| Y’know I can’t even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I can’t believe how much I love her, I can’t get enough of her, like right now I miss her. I actually miss her.
Phoebe|Phoebe| You know that’s… that’s her.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh god look at her sleeping. Oh, I love her so much! Oh, I think I’m gonna wake her up.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you’re never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
Rachel|Rachel| Well I can do whatever I want! I made her!  Come on little girl, hi!
Phoebe|Phoebe| I can say I told you so but she’s kinda doing that for me.
Rachel|Rachel| Oh I’m sorry mummy’s so sorry go back to sleep go back to sleep. Shh.  Shhh! Go back to sleep
Monica|Monica| Breaks your heart doesn’t it
Phoebe|Phoebe| It really does… how long do you think we have to stay?
Ms. McKenna|Other| Ok if everyone’s on board, it’s settled, Chandler,  Chandler?
Chandler|Chandler| Yep.
Ms. McKenna|Other| Are you on board?
Chandler|Chandler|  Yes.
Ms. McKenna|Other| Then, problem solved. Chandler will be running our office in Tulsa. You’re gonna love Oklahoma.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!
Monica|Monica| Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
Rachel|Rachel| Ok. 
Monica|Monica| It worked!
Rachel|Rachel| Oh  oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit.  Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won’t stop crying.
Monica|Monica| Umm, she Rach, not it, she. 
Rachel|Rachel| Yeah, I’m not so sure.
Monica|Monica| Oh my god, I am losing my mind.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from having sex with Ross!
Ross|Ross| Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go? 
Gunther|Other| Diapers huh?
Ross|Ross| Yep.
Gunther|Other| So I guess Rachel had you baby?
Ross|Ross| Yep, can you believe it?
Gunther|Other| Nope! I still can’t believe she slept with you in the first place.
Ross|Ross| Huh? Ooh  you mean like a… Huh?
Joey|Joey|  Hey.  Ross, I know you’re pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
Ross|Ross| Ah actually we don’t.  
Joey|Joey| Fine, fine okay. But I gotta say technically, I didn’t even do anything wrong.
Ross|Ross|  What!  You didn’t do anything wrong?!
Joey|Joey| I said I didn’t technically.
Ross|Ross|" Okay let’s put aside that you  ""accidentally"" picked up my grandmothers ring and you  ""accidentally"" proposed to Rachel."
Joey|Joey| Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this  I don’t really know what that means.  You were saying?
Ross|Ross| And I can even understand that you couldn’t tell Rachel, but why couldn’t you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn’t.
Joey|Joey|" I know I should’ve.  ""I’m sorry."" "
Ross|Ross| Not using it right, Joe.
Ross|Ross| I’m gonna go.
Joey|Joey| No, come on Ross!  Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
Ross|Ross| Give me the bag.
Joey|Joey| No, look, I don’t know what else to do. I said I’m sorry!
Ross|Ross| Joey!
Joey|Joey| You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
Ross|Ross| I’m not gonna hit you.
Joey|Joey| Why not? You’ll feel better! I’ll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
Ross|Ross| No I don’t.
Joey|Joey| A little bit.
Ross|Ross| No.
Joey|Joey| Little bit.
Ross|Ross| No!
Joey|Joey|  A little bit more.
Ross|Ross| Give me the bag.
Joey|Joey| No, hit me
Ross|Ross| Give me the bag.

Ross|Ross| You ducked!!
Joey|Joey| I’m sorry! It was a reflex! 
Ross|Ross| Oh my god, this really hurts!!!
Joey|Joey| I couldn’t help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look! 
Ross|Ross| What is the matter with you?!?
Joey|Joey| You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn’t you duck?
Ross|Ross| Why don’t we talk about this on the way to the hospital?
Joey|Joey|" Good, good yeah,  maybe while we’re there, they can check your reflexes.   ""Oops."""
Monica|Monica| Try feeding her again.
Rachel|Rachel| I already fed her.
Monica|Monica| I know, that’s why I said again!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay? That’s just what she wants.
Chandler|Chandler|  Hey.
Monica|Monica| Hey.
Chandler|Chandler| Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Rachel|Rachel| Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I’m gonna go check her diaper, Pheebs you wanna come?
Phoebe|Phoebe| Oh I’m kinda part of this.
Chandler|Chandler| Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
Phoebe|Phoebe| I knew I should have married Chandler.
Monica|Monica| Okay what’s up
Chandler|Chandler| Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
Monica|Monica| Oh yeah .
Chandler|Chandler| Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
Monica|Monica| What? Who says that?
Chandler|Chandler| People who’ve never ever been to Paris.
Monica|Monica| What’s going on?
Chandler|Chandler| We’re moving to Tulsa! 
Monica|Monica| Excuse me?
Chandler|Chandler| Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.
Monica|Monica|  Tulsa, Oklahoma!
Chandler|Chandler| The Sooner State, whatever that is.
Monica|Monica| Chandler, I don’t even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!
Chandler|Chandler| Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
Monica|Monica| Are you trying to tell me that we’re moving to Oklahoma, or that you’re gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
Chandler|Chandler| No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus.  I’ll get out of it.
Monica|Monica| Thank you.
Chandler|Chandler|  What is wrong with Emma?
Monica|Monica| Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.
Chandler|Chandler| Umm ma’am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa.
Ms. McKenna|Other| What?
Chandler|Chandler| It’s a funny story, actually.  I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really know what I was saying.
Ms. McKenna|Other| You fell asleep?
Chandler|Chandler| But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, here’s the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. See, me, I love Tulsa! Tulsa is heaven! Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go there!
Ms. McKenna|Other| Chandler, I…
Chandler|Chandler| No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol?  Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping!  That’s a picture of your daughter, isn’t it, well she’s lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. I’ll call you from Tulsa. 
Joey|Joey| Hey, so how is it?
Ross|Ross| I broke my thumb.
Joey|Joey| Your thumb? That’s weird.  You sure you’re punching right? Make a fist.  Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.
Ross|Ross| You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms. 
Joey|Joey| You, you want me to help you with that?
Ross|Ross| Why, does it look like I’m having trouble with my misshapen claw? 
Joey|Joey| Name?  I know Ross but what’s it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.
Ross|Ross| Just Ross!
Joey|Joey| It’s pretty, Okay date of birth?
Ross|Ross| You know my birthday.
Joey|Joey| Sure, May...tember.
Ross|Ross| October 18th.
Joey|Joey| Occupation? Dinosaurs.
Ross|Ross| Actually I’m a palian… Dinosaurs is fine… the drawing is not.
Joey|Joey| Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?
Ross|Ross| Ah, Rachel I guess.
Joey|Joey| Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.
Ross|Ross| Just ah… just put roommate.
Joey|Joey| Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you’re gonna get together right?
Ross|Ross| I don’t think that we are.
Joey|Joey| But you two were supposed to be together.
Ross|Ross| Well, I thought so too, but then she said she’d marry you.
Joey|Joey| Come on, Ross, that didn’t mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.
Ross|Ross| Yeah that’s what she said.
Joey|Joey| So?
Ross|Ross| So I don’t wanna be just anybody.
Joey|Joey| Wow.
Ross|Ross| You know what, it’s, it’s better this way anyway. I mean I don’t know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It’s just much easier if we’re just friends who have a kid.
Joey|Joey| Really?
Ross|Ross| Yeah.
Joey|Joey| And you’re Okay with that?
Ross|Ross| Yes. I mean, it’s what we always planned. And if you have a plan, you should stick to it. That’s why they call them plans. Hello?  I’m fine.
Joey|Joey|" Hey, for what it’s worth, with Rachel I don’t think you’ll ever be just  ""anybody."""
Ross|Ross| Hey there you go! 
Joey|Joey|"  ""Thanks."""
Rachel|Rachel| Oh my God! How long has she been crying?
Monica|Monica| About a week and a half.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I’m just gonna go.  No! Really? Misery really does love company. All right! 
Monica|Monica| Rach, try holding her a different way.
Rachel|Rachel| You guys, I’m doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.
Phoebe|Phoebe| Alright, I’ll try, fine! Yes, Okay!
Rachel|Rachel| Here you go. 
Phoebe|Phoebe| Shh! Nothing works with this child! 
Rachel|Rachel| Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can’t even comfort my own baby! I’m the worst mother ever!
Monica|Monica| You’re just new at this, it’ll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn’t have been easy but you figured that out.
Rachel|Rachel| Yeah I don’t think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.
Monica|Monica| Okay I’ll take her, here. 
Rachel|Rachel| I have to go to the bathroom. 
Phoebe|Phoebe| I have to go scream into a pillow. 
Monica|Monica|  Bouncy baby, Bouncy baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby, Ooh baby baby. 
Phoebe|Phoebe|  Have I gone deaf?
Monica|Monica| It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!
Phoebe|Phoebe| You must be a fireball in bed.
Monica|Monica| I can’t believe it! She’s asleep! I got her to go to sleep!  I have actual magical powers!
Phoebe|Phoebe| I can hear traffic and birds! I can hear the voices in my head again!  I’m kidding. 
Rachel|Rachel| Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!
Monica|Monica| Yes I did, I’m Monica, Super Aunt
Rachel|Rachel| You are the official baby crier stopper!
Monica|Monica| Yes I am!!
Rachel|Rachel| You’re never leaving the apartment!
Monica|Monica| Say what?

Monica|Monica|  Oh no no no no!
Phoebe|Phoebe| Thankfully you don’t need me at all  so Okay Super aunt see you later! Rachel let’s give it six to eight months .
Rachel|Rachel| Okay so listen I’m gonna go lay down.
Monica|Monica| What?
Rachel|Rachel| You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should be sleeping so… 
Chandler|Chandler|  Hey!
Monica|Monica| Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep
Chandler|Chandler| Oh so there can’t be any yelling.
Monica|Monica| No.
Chandler|Chandler| We’re moving to Tulsa
Monica|Monica|  What!?
Chandler|Chandler| Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh!  I can’t, I can’t hear you. 
Ross|Ross| Hey.
